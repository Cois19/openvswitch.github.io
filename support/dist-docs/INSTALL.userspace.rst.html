<p>Open vSwitch can operate, at a cost in performance, entirely in userspace,
without assistance from a kernel module.  This file explains how to install
Open vSwitch in such a mode.</p>
<p>This version of Open vSwitch should be built manually with <tt class="docutils literal">configure</tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal">make</tt>.  Debian packaging for Open vSwitch is also included, but it has not
been recently tested, and so Debian packages are not a recommended way to use
this version of Open vSwitch.</p>
<div class="warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">The userspace-only mode of Open vSwitch is considered experimental.  It has
not been thoroughly tested.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="building-and-installing">
<h1>Building and Installing</h1>
<p>The requirements and procedure for building, installing, and configuring Open
vSwitch are the same as those given in the <a class="reference external" href="INSTALL.rst">installation guide</a>.  You may omit configuring, building, and installing the
kernel module, and the related requirements.</p>
<p>On Linux, the userspace switch additionally requires the kernel TUN/TAP driver
to be available, either built into the kernel or loaded as a module.  If you
are not sure, check for a directory named <tt class="docutils literal">/sys/class/misc/tun</tt>.  If it does
not exist, then attempt to load the module with <tt class="docutils literal">modprobe tun</tt>.</p>
<p>The tun device must also exist as <tt class="docutils literal">/dev/net/tun</tt>.  If it does not exist, then
create <tt class="docutils literal">/dev/net</tt> (if necessary) with <tt class="docutils literal">mkdir /dev/net</tt>, then create
<tt class="docutils literal">/dev/net/tun</tt> with <tt class="docutils literal">mknod /dev/net/tun c 10 200</tt>.</p>
<p>On FreeBSD and NetBSD, the userspace switch additionally requires the kernel
tap(4) driver to be available, either built into the kernel or loaded as a
module.</p>

<div class="section" id="using-the-userspace-datapath-with-ovs-vswitchd">
<h1>Using the Userspace Datapath with ovs-vswitchd</h1>
<p>To use ovs-vswitchd in userspace mode, create a bridge with
<tt class="docutils literal">datapath_type=netdev</tt> in the configuration database.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl add-br br0
$ ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 datapath_type=netdev
$ ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth0
$ ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth1
$ ovs-vsctl add-port br0 eth2
</pre>
<p>ovs-vswitchd will create a TAP device as the bridge's local interface, named
the same as the bridge, as well as for each configured internal interface.</p>
<p>Currently, on FreeBSD, the functionality required for in-band control support
is not implemented.  To avoid related errors, you can disable the in-band
support with the following command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl set bridge br0 other_config:disable-in-band=true
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="firewall-rules">
<h1>Firewall Rules</h1>
<p>On Linux, when a physical interface is in use by the userspace datapath,
packets received on the interface still also pass into the kernel TCP/IP stack.
This can cause surprising and incorrect behavior.  You can use &quot;iptables&quot; to
avoid this behavior, by using it to drop received packets.  For example, to
drop packets received on eth0:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -j DROP
$ iptables -A FORWARD -i eth0 -j DROP
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="other-settings">
<h1>Other Settings</h1>
<p>On NetBSD, depending on your network topology and applications, the following
configuration might help.  See sysctl(7).:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ sysctl -w net.inet.ip.checkinterface=1
</pre>
