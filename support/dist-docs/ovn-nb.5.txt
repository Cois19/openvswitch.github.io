NAME
       ovn-nb - OVN_Northbound database schema

       This  database  is  the  interface between OVN and the cloud management
       system (CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it.   The  CMS  produces
       almost  all  of  the  contents of the database.  The ovn-northd program
       monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it  into  the
       OVN_Southbound database.

       We  generally  speak  of  ``the’’ CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
       which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment.

   External IDs
       Each of the tables in this database contains a  special  column,  named
       external_ids.   This column has the same form and purpose each place it
       appears.

              external_ids: map of string-string pairs
                     Key-value pairs for use by the CMS.  The  CMS  might  use
                     certain  pairs,  for example, to identify entities in its
                     own configuration that correspond to those in this  data‐
                     base.

TABLE SUMMARY
       The  following list summarizes the purpose of each of the tables in the
       OVN_Northbound database.  Each table is described in more detail  on  a
       later page.

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string
              A name for the logical switch.  This name has no special meaning
              or purpose other than to provide convenience for human  interac‐
              tion  with the ovn-nb database.  There is no requirement for the
              name to be unique.  The logical switch’s UUID should be used  as
              the unique identifier.

       ports: set of Logical_Ports
              The logical ports connected to the logical switch.

              It is an error for multiple logical switches to include the same
              logical port.

       acls: set of ACLs
              Access control rules that apply to packets  within  the  logical
              switch.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
     Core Features:

       name: string (must be unique within table)
              The logical port name.

              For  entities (VMs or containers) that are spawned in the hyper‐
              visor, the name used here must match those used  in  the  exter‐
              nal_ids:iface-id in the Open_vSwitch database’s Interface table,
              because hypervisors use external_ids:iface-id as a lookup key to
              identify the network interface of that entity.

              For containers that share a VIF within a VM, the name can be any
              unique identifier.  See Containers, below, for more information.

       type: string
              Specify a type for this logical port.  Logical ports can be used
              to model other types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch.
              The following types are defined:

              (empty string)
                     A VM (or VIF) interface.

              router A connection to a logical router.

              localnet
                     A connection to a locally accessible  network  from  each
                     ovn-controller  instance.  A logical switch can only have
                     a single localnet port attached and at most  one  regular
                     logical  port.  This is used to model direct connectivity
                     to an existing network.

              vtep   A port to a logical switch on a VTEP gateway.

     Options:

       options: map of string-string pairs
              This column provides key/value settings specific to the  logical
              port type.  The type-specific options are described individually
              below.

     Options for router ports:
       These options apply when type is router.

       If a  given  logical  switch  has  multiple  router  ports,  the  Logi‐
       cal_Router_Port  rows that they reference must be all on the same Logi‐
       cal_Router (for different subnets).

       options : router-port: optional string, containing an uuid
              Required.  The UUID of the  Logical_Router_Port  to  which  this
              logical switch port is connected.

     Options for localnet ports:
       These options apply when type is localnet.

       options : network_name: optional string
              Required.  The name of the network to which the localnet port is
              connected.  Each hypervisor, via ovn-controller, uses its  local
              configuration  to  determine  exactly  how  to  connect  to this
              locally accessible network.

     Options for vtep ports:
       These options apply when type is vtep.

       options : vtep-physical-switch: optional string
              Required.  The name of the VTEP gateway.

       options : vtep-logical-switch: optional string
              Required.  A logical switch name connected by the VTEP gateway.

     Containers:
       When a large number of containers are nested within a VM, it may be too
       expensive  to  dedicate a VIF to each container.  OVN can use VLAN tags
       to support such cases.  Each container is assigned a VLAN ID  and  each
       packet that passes between the hypervisor and the VM is tagged with the
       appropriate ID for the container.  Such VLAN  IDs  never  appear  on  a
       physical  wire, even inside a tunnel, so they need not be unique except
       relative to a single VM on a hypervisor.

       These columns are used for VIFs that represent nested containers  using
       shared VIFs.  For VMs and for containers that have dedicated VIFs, they
       are empty.

       parent_name: optional string
              The VM interface through which the nested  container  sends  its
              network traffic.  This must match the name column for some other
              Logical_Port.

       tag: optional integer, in range 1 to 4,095
              The VLAN tag in the  network  traffic  associated  with  a  con‐
              tainer’s network interface.

              When  type  is set to localnet, this can be set to indicate that
              the port represents a connection to a specific VLAN on a locally
              accessible  network. The VLAN ID is used to match incoming traf‐
              fic and is also added to outgoing traffic.

     Port State:

       up: optional boolean
              This column is populated by ovn-northd, rather than by  the  CMS
              plugin  as  is  most  of  this database.  When a logical port is
              bound to a physical location  in  the  OVN  Southbound  database
              Binding  table,  ovn-northd sets this column to true; otherwise,
              or if the port becomes unbound later, it sets it to false.  This
              allows the CMS to wait for a VM’s (or container’s) networking to
              become active before it allows the VM (or container) to start.

       enabled: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this
              column is empty or is set to true, the port is enabled.  If this
              column is set to false, the port is disabled.  A  disabled  port
              has all ingress and egress traffic dropped.

     Addressing:

       addresses: set of strings
              Addresses owned by the logical port.

              Each element in the set must take one of the following forms:

              xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
                     An  Ethernet  address  owned by the logical port.  Like a
                     physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port  ordinarily  has  a
                     single fixed Ethernet address.

                     When  a  OVN  logical switch processes a unicast Ethernet
                     frame whose destination  MAC  address  is  in  a  logical
                     port’s  addresses  column,  it  delivers  it only to that
                     port, as if a MAC learning process had learned  that  MAC
                     address on the port.

              xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx a.b.c.d
                     This  form  has all the effects of the previous form.  It
                     also indicates that the logical port owns the given  IPv4
                     address.

                     The  OVN  logical switch uses this information to synthe‐
                     size responses to ARP  requests  without  traversing  the
                     physical  network.   The  OVN logical router connected to
                     the logical switch, if  any,  uses  this  information  to
                     avoid issuing ARP requests for logical switch ports.

              unknown
                     This  indicates  that the logical port has an unknown set
                     of Ethernet addresses.  When an OVN logical  switch  pro‐
                     cesses  a  unicast  Ethernet  frame whose destination MAC
                     address is not in any logical port’s addresses column, it
                     delivers  it  to the port (or ports) whose addresses col‐
                     umns include unknown.

       port_security: set of strings
              A set of L2 (Ethernet) addresses from which the logical port  is
              allowed  to  send  packets and to which it is allowed to receive
              packets.  If this column is empty, all addresses are  permitted.
              Logical ports are always allowed to receive packets addressed to
              multicast and broadcast addresses.

              Each member of the set  is  an  Ethernet  address  in  the  form
              xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.

              This specification will be extended to support L3 port security.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

ACL TABLE
       Each  row  in  this  table represents one ACL rule for a logical switch
       that points to it through its acls column.  The action column  for  the
       highest-priority  matching  row  in  this  table  determines a packet’s
       treatment.   If  no  row  matches,  packets  are  allowed  by  default.
       (Default-deny  treatment  is possible: add a rule with priority 0, 0 as
       match, and deny as action.)

   Summary:
       priority                      integer, in range 0 to 32,767
       direction                     string, either to-lport or from-lport
       match                         string
       action                        string,  one  of   allow-related,   drop,
                                     allow, or reject
       log                           boolean
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       priority: integer, in range 0 to 32,767
              The ACL rule’s priority.  Rules with numerically higher priority
              take precedence over those with lower.  If two  ACL  rules  with
              the same priority both match, then the one actually applied to a
              packet is undefined.

              Return traffic from an allow-related flow is always allowed  and
              cannot be changed through an ACL.

       direction: string, either to-lport or from-lport
              Direction of the traffic to which this rule should apply:

              ·      from-lport: Used to implement filters on traffic arriving
                     from a logical port.  These rules are applied to the log‐
                     ical switch’s ingress pipeline.

              ·      to-lport:  Used to implement filters on traffic forwarded
                     to a logical port.  These rules are applied to the  logi‐
                     cal switch’s egress pipeline.

       match: string
              The  packets  that  the ACL should match, in the same expression
              language used for the match column in the OVN  Southbound  data‐
              base’s  Logical_Flow  table.   The  outport logical port is only
              available in the to-lport direction (the inport is available  in
              both directions).

              By default all traffic is allowed.  When writing a more restric‐
              tive policy, it is important to remember to allow flows such  as
              ARP and IPv6 neighbor discovery packets.

       action: string, one of allow-related, drop, allow, or reject
              The action to take when the ACL rule matches:

              ·      allow: Forward the packet.

              ·      allow-related:  Forward  the  packet  and related traffic
                     (e.g. inbound replies to an outbound connection).

              ·      drop: Silently drop the packet.

              ·      reject: Drop the packet, replying with a RST for  TCP  or
                     ICMP  unreachable  message  for other IP-based protocols.
                     Not implemented--currently treated as drop

       log: boolean
              If set to true, packets that match the ACL will  trigger  a  log
              message on the transport node or nodes that perform ACL process‐
              ing.  Logging may be combined with any action.

              Logging is not yet implemented.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Logical_Router TABLE
       Each row represents one L3 logical router.

   Summary:
       name                          string
       ports                         set of Logical_Router_Ports

       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string
              A name for the logical router.  This name has no special meaning
              or  purpose other than to provide convenience for human interac‐
              tion with the ovn-nb database.  There is no requirement for  the
              name  to be unique.  The logical router’s UUID should be used as
              the unique identifier.

       ports: set of Logical_Router_Ports
              The router’s ports.

       default_gw: optional string
              IP address to use as default gateway, if any.

     Common Columns:

       external_ids: map of string-string pairs
              See External IDs at the beginning of this document.

Logical_Router_Port TABLE
       A port within an L3 logical router.

       Exactly one Logical_Router row must reference a  given  logical  router
       port.

   Summary:
       name                          string
       network                       string
       mac                           string
       enabled                       optional boolean
       Attachment:
         peer                        optional Logical_Router_Port
       Common Columns:
         external_ids                map of string-string pairs

   Details:
       name: string
              A  name  for  the logical router port.  This name has no special
              meaning or purpose other than to provide convenience  for  human
              interaction  with  the ovn-nb database.  There is no requirement
              for the name to be  unique.   The  logical  router  port’s  UUID
              should be used as the unique identifier.

       network: string
              The  IP  address  of  the  router and the netmask.  For example,
              192.168.0.1/24  indicates  that  the  router’s  IP  address   is
              192.168.0.1  and  that packets destined to 192.168.0.x should be
              routed to this port.

       mac: string
              The Ethernet address that belongs to this router port.

       enabled: optional boolean
              This column is used to administratively set port state.  If this
              column is empty or is set to true, the port is enabled.  If this
              column is set to false, the port is disabled.  A  disabled  port
              has all ingress and egress traffic dropped.

     Attachment:
       A given router port serves one of two purposes:

              ·      To  attach a logical switch to a logical router.  A logi‐
                     cal router port of this type is referenced by exactly one
