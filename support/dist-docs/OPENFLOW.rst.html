<p>Open vSwitch support for OpenFlow 1.1 and beyond is a work in progress.  This
file describes the work still to be done.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-plan">
<h1>The Plan</h1>
<p>OpenFlow version support is not a build-time option.  A single build of Open
vSwitch must be able to handle all supported versions of OpenFlow.  Ideally,
even at runtime it should be able to support all protocol versions at the same
time on different OpenFlow bridges (and perhaps even on the same bridge).</p>
<p>At the same time, it would be a shame to litter the core of the OVS code with
lots of ugly code concerned with the details of various OpenFlow protocol
versions.</p>
<p>The primary approach to compatibility is to abstract most of the details of the
differences from the core code, by adding a protocol layer that translates
between OF1.x and a slightly higher-level abstract representation.  The core of
this approach is the many <tt class="docutils literal">struct ofputil_*</tt> structures in
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">include/openvswitch/ofp-util.h</span></tt>.</p>
<p>As a consequence of this approach, OVS cannot use OpenFlow protocol definitions
that closely resemble those in the OpenFlow specification, because
<tt class="docutils literal">openflow.h</tt> in different versions of the OpenFlow specification defines the
same identifier with different values.  Instead, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">openflow-common.h</span></tt> contains
definitions that are common to all the specifications and separate protocol
version-specific headers contain protocol-specific definitions renamed so as
not to conflict, e.g. <tt class="docutils literal">OFPAT10_ENQUEUE</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">OFPAT11_ENQUEUE</tt> for the
OpenFlow 1.0 and 1.1 values for <tt class="docutils literal">OFPAT_ENQUEUE</tt>.  Generally, in cases of
conflict, the protocol layer will define a more abstract <tt class="docutils literal">OFPUTIL_*</tt> or
struct <tt class="docutils literal">ofputil_*</tt>.</p>
<p>Here are the current approaches in a few tricky areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Port numbering.</p>
<p>OpenFlow 1.0 has 16-bit port numbers and later OpenFlow versions have 32-bit
port numbers.  For now, OVS support for later protocol versions requires all
port numbers to fall into the 16-bit range, translating the reserved
<tt class="docutils literal">OFPP_*</tt> port numbers.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Actions.</p>
<p>OpenFlow 1.0 and later versions have very different ideas of actions.  OVS
reconciles by translating all the versions' actions (and instructions) to and
from a common internal representation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openflow-1-1">
<h1>OpenFlow 1.1</h1>
<p>The list of remaining work items for OpenFlow 1.1 is below.  It is probably
incomplete.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Match and set double-tagged VLANs (QinQ).</p>
<p>This requires kernel work for reasonable performance.</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.1+)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">VLANs tagged with 88a8 Ethertype.</p>
<p>This requires kernel work for reasonable performance.</p>
<p>(required for OF1.1+)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openflow-1-2">
<h1>OpenFlow 1.2</h1>
<p>OpenFlow 1.2 support requires OpenFlow 1.1 as a prerequisite. All the
additional work specific to Openflow 1.2 are complete.  (This is based on the
change log at the end of the OF1.2 spec.  I didn't compare the specs carefully
yet.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="openflow-1-3">
<h1>OpenFlow 1.3</h1>
<p>OpenFlow 1.3 support requires OpenFlow 1.2 as a prerequisite, plus the
following additional work.  (This is based on the change log at the end of the
OF1.3 spec, reusing most of the section titles directly.  I didn't compare the
specs carefully yet.)</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Add support for multipart requests.</p>
<p>Currently we always report <tt class="docutils literal">OFPBRC_MULTIPART_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</tt>.</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.3+)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">IPv6 extension header handling support.</p>
<p>Fully implementing this requires kernel support.  This likely will take some
careful and probably time-consuming design work.  The actual coding, once
that is all done, is probably 2 or 3 days work.</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.3+)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Per-flow meters.</p>
<p>OpenFlow protocol support is now implemented.  Support for the special
<tt class="docutils literal">OFPM_SLOWPATH</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">OFPM_CONTROLLER</tt> meters is missing.  Support for
the software switch is under review.</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.3+)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Auxiliary connections.</p>
<p>An implementation in generic code might be a week's worth of work.  The value
of an implementation in generic code is questionable, though, since much of
the benefit of axuiliary connections is supposed to be to take advantage of
hardware support.  (We could make the kernel module somehow send packets
across the auxiliary connections directly, for some kind of &quot;hardware&quot;
support, if we judged it useful enough.)</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.3+)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Provider Backbone Bridge tagging.</p>
<p>I don't plan to implement this (but we'd accept an implementation).</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.3+)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">On-demand flow counters.</p>
<p>I think this might be a real optimization in some cases for the software
switch.</p>
<p>(optional for OF1.3+)</p>
</li>

<h1>How to contribute</h1>
<p>If you plan to contribute code for a feature, please let everyone know on
ovs-dev before you start work.  This will help avoid duplicating work.</p>
<p>Please consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Testing.  Please test your code.</li>
<li>Unit tests.  Please consider writing some.  The tests directory has many
examples that you can use as a starting point.</li>
<li>ovs-ofctl.  If you add a feature that is useful for some ovs-ofctl command
then you should add support for it there.</li>
<li>Documentation.  If you add a user-visible feature, then you should document
it in the appropriate manpage and mention it in NEWS as well.</li>
<li>Coding style (see the <a class="reference external" href="CodingStyle.rst">coding style guide</a> file at the top
of the source tree).</li>
<li>The <a class="reference external" href="CONTRIBUTING.rst">patch submission guidelines</a>.  I recommend using
&quot;git send-email&quot;, which automatically follows a lot of those guidelines.</li>
