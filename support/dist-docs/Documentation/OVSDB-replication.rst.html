<p>Given two Open vSwitch databases with the same schema, OVSDB replication keeps
these databases in the same state, i.e. each of the databases have the same
contents at any given time even if they are not running in the same host.  This
document elaborates on the implementation details to provide this
functionality.</p>

<h1>Design</h1>
<p>The overall design of replication consists of one ovsdb-server (active server)
communicating the state of its databases to another ovsdb-server (standby
server) so that the latter keep its own databases in that same state.  To
achieve this, the standby server acts as a client of the active server, in the
sense that it sends a monitor request to keep up to date with the changes in
the active server databases. When a notification from the active server
arrives, the standby server executes the necessary set of operations so its
databases reach the same state as the the active server databases. Below is the
design represented as a diagram.:</p>

<div class="section" id="setting-up-the-replication">
<h1>Setting Up The Replication</h1>
<p>To initiate the replication process, the standby server must be executed
indicating the location of the active server via the command line option
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--sync-from=server</span></tt>, where server can take any form described in the
ovsdb-client manpage and it must specify an active connection type (tcp, unix,
ssl). This option will cause the standby server to attempt to send a monitor
request to the active server in every main loop iteration, until the active
server responds.</p>
<p>When sending a monitor request the standby server is doing the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Erase the content of the databases for which it is providing a RPC
interface.</li>
<li>Open the jsonrpc channel to communicate with the active server.</li>
<li>Fetch all the databases located in the active server.</li>
<li>For each database with the same schema in both the active and standby
servers: construct and send a monitor request message specifying the tables
that will be monitored (i.e all the tables on the database except the ones
blacklisted [*]).</li>
<li>Set the standby database to the current state of the active database.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the monitor request message is sent, the standby server will continuously
receive notifications of changes occurring to the tables specified in the
request. The process of handling this notifications is detailed in the next
section.</p>
<p>[*] A set of tables that will be excluded from replication can be configure as
a blacklist of tables via the command line option
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--sync-exclude-tables=db:table[,db:table]...</span></tt>, where db corresponds to the
database where the table resides.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="replication-process">
<h1>Replication Process</h1>
<p>The replication process consists on handling the update notifications received
in the standby server caused by the monitor request that was previously sent to
the active server. In every loop iteration, the standby server attempts to
receive a message from the active server which can be an error, an echo message
(used to keep the connection alive) or an update notification. In case the
message is a fatal error, the standby server will disconnect from the active
without dropping the replicated data. If it is an echo message, the standby
server will reply with an echo message as well. If the message is an update
notification, the following process occurs:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Create a new transaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Get the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;table-updates&gt;</span></tt> object from the <tt class="docutils literal">params</tt> member of the
notification.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;table-update&gt;</span></tt> in the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;table-updates&gt;</span></tt> object do:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>For each <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;row-update&gt;</span></tt> in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;table-update&gt;</span></tt> check what kind of
operation should be executed according to the following criteria
about the presence of the object members:<ul>
<li>If <tt class="docutils literal">old</tt> member is not present, execute an insert operation using
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;row&gt;</tt> from the <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> member.</li>
<li>If <tt class="docutils literal">old</tt> member is present and <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> member is not present,
execute a delete operation using <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;row&gt;</tt> from the <tt class="docutils literal">old</tt> member</li>
<li>If both <tt class="docutils literal">old</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> members are present, execute an update
operation using <tt class="docutils literal">&lt;row&gt;</tt> from the <tt class="docutils literal">new</tt> member.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Commit the transaction.</p>
<p>If an error occurs during the replication process, all replication is
restarted by resending a new monitor request as described in the section
&quot;Setting up the replication&quot;.</p>
</li>
