<p>This document describes the process ordinarily used for Open vSwitch
development and release.  Exceptions are sometimes necessary, so all of the
statements here should be taken as subject to change through rough consensus of
Open vSwitch contributors, obtained through public discussion on, e.g., ovs-dev
or the #openvswitch IRC channel.</p>
<div class="section" id="release-strategy">
<h1>Release Strategy</h1>
<p>Open vSwitch feature development takes place on the &quot;master&quot; branch.
Ordinarily, new features are rebased against master and applied directly.  For
features that take significant development, sometimes it is more appropriate to
merge a separate branch into master; please discuss this on ovs-dev in advance.</p>
<p>Periodically, the OVS developers fork a branch from master to become an
official release.  These release branches are named for expected release
number, e.g. &quot;branch-2.3&quot; for the branch that will yield Open vSwitch 2.3.x.
Release branches should receive only bug fixes, not new features.  Bug fixes
applied to release branches should be backports of corresponding bug fixes to
the master branch, except for bugs present only on release branches (which are
rare in practice).</p>
<p>Sometimes there can be exceptions to the rule that a release branch receives
only bug fixes.  In particular, after a release branch is created, but before
the first actual release from that branch, it can be appropriate to add
features.  Like bug fixes, new features on release branches should be backports
of the corresponding commits on the master branch.  Features to be added to
release branches should be limited in scope and risk and discussed on ovs-dev
before creating the branch.</p>
<p>After a period of testing and stabilization, and rough consensus obtained from
contributors that the release is ready, the developers release the .0 release
on its branch, e.g. 2.3.0 for branch-2.3.  To make the actual release, a
developer pushes a signed tag named, e.g. v2.3.0, to the Open vSwitch
repository, makes a release tarball available on openvswitch.org, and posts a
release announcement to ovs-announce.</p>
<p>As a number of bug fixes accumulate, or after important bugs or vulnerabilities
are fixed, the OVS developers may make additional releases from a branch:
2.3.1, 2.3.2, and so on.  The process is the same for these additional release
as for a .0 release.</p>
<p>At most two release branches are formally maintained at any given time: the
latest release and the latest release designed as LTS.  An LTS release is one
that the OVS project has designated as being maintained for a longer period of
time.  Currently, an LTS release is maintained until the next LTS is chosen.
There is not currently a strict guideline on how often a new LTS release is
chosen, but so far it has been about every 2 years.  That could change based on
the current state of OVS development.  For example, we do not want to designate
a new release as LTS that includes disruptive internal changes, as that may
make it harder to support for a longer period of time.  Discussion about
choosing the next LTS release occurs on the OVS development mailing list.</p>

<div class="section" id="release-numbering">
<h1>Release Numbering</h1>
<p>The version number on master should normally end in .90.  This indicates that
the Open vSwitch version is &quot;almost&quot; the next version to branch.</p>
<p>Forking master into branch-x.y requires two commits to master.  The first is
titled &quot;Prepare for x.y.0&quot; and increments the version number to x.y.  This is
the initial commit on branch-x.y.  The second is titled &quot;Prepare for post-x.y.0
(x.y.90)&quot; and increments the version number to x.y.90.</p>
<p>The version number on a release branch is x.y.z, where z is initially 0.
Making a release requires two commits.  The first is titled <em>Set release dates
for x.y.z.</em> and updates NEWS and debian/changelog to specify the release date
of the new release.  This commit is the one made into a tarball and tagged.
The second is titled <em>Prepare for x.y.(z+1).</em> and increments the version number
and adds a blank item to NEWS with an unspecified date.</p>
