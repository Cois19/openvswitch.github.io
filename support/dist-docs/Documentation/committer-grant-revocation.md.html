<h1>OVS Committer Grant/Revocation Policy</h1>

<p>An OVS committer is a participant in the project with the ability
to commit code directly to the master repository. Commit access
grants a broad ability to affect the progress of the project as
presented by its most important artifact, the code and related
resources that produce working binaries of Open vSwitch. As such
it represents a significant level of trust in an individual's
commitment to working with other committers and the community at
large for the benefit of the project. It can not be granted
lightly and, in the worst case, must be revocable if the trust
placed in an individual was inappropriate.</p>

<p>This document suggests guidelines for granting and revoking commit
access. It is intended to provide a framework for evaluation of such
decisions without specifying deterministic rules that wouldn't be
sensitive to the nuance of specific situations. In the end the
decision to grant or revoke committer privileges is a judgment call
made by the existing set of committers.</p>

<h2>Granting Commit Access</h2>

<p>Granting commit access should be considered when a candidate has
demonstrated the following in their interaction with the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contribution of significant new features through the patch
submission process where:
<ul>
<li>Submissions are free of obvious critical defects</li>
<li>Submissions do not typically require many iterations of
improvement to be accepted</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Consistent participation in code review of other's patches,
including existing committers, with comments consistent with the
overall project standards</li>
<li>Assistance to those in the community who are less knowledgeable
through active participation in project forums such as the
ovs-discuss mailing list.</li>
<li>Plans for sustained contribution to the project compatible with
the project's direction as viewed by current committers.</li>
<li>Commitment to meet the expectations described in the
"Expectations of Developer's with Open vSwitch Access"</li>
</ul>

<p>The process to grant commit access to a candidate is simple:</p>

<ul>
<li>An existing committer nominates the candidate by sending an
email to all existing committers with information
substantiating the contributions of the candidate in the areas
described above.</li>
<li>All existing committers discuss the pros and cons of granting
commit access to the candidate in the email thread.</li>
<li>When the discussion has converged or a reasonable time has
elapsed without discussion developing (e.g. a few business days)
the nominator calls for a final decision on the candidate with a
followup email to the thread.</li>
<li>Each committer may vote yes, no, or abstain by replying to the
email thread. A failure to reply is an implicit abstention.</li>
<li>After votes from all existing committers have been collected or a
reasonable time has elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a
couple of business days) the votes are evaluated. To be granted
commit access the candidate must receive yes votes from a
majority of the existing committers and zero no votes. Since a
no vote is effectively a veto of the candidate it should be
accompanied by a reason for the vote.</li>
<li>The nominator summarizes the result of the vote in an email to
all existing committers.</li>
<li>If the vote to grant commit access passed, the candidate is
contacted with an invitation to become a committer to the project
which asks them to agree to the committer expectations
documented on the project web site.</li>
<li>If the candidate agrees access is granted by setting up commit
access to the repos on github.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Revoking Commit Access</h2>

<p>There are two situations in which commit access might be revoked.</p>

<p>The straightforward situation is a committer who is no longer
active in the project and has no plans to become active in the near
future. The process in this case is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any time after a committer has been inactive for more than 6
months any other committer to the project may identify that
committer as a candidate for revocation of commit access due to
inactivity.</li>
<li>The plans of revocation should be sent in a private email to the
candidate.</li>
<li>If the candidate for removal states plans to continue
participating no action is taken and this process terminates.</li>
<li>If the candidate replies they no longer require commit
access then commit access is removed and a notification is
sent to the candidate and all existing committers.</li>
<li>If the candidate can not be reached within 1 week of the first
attempting to contact this process continues.</li>
<li>A message proposing removal of commit access is sent to the
candidate and all other committers.</li>
<li>If the candidate for removal states plans to continue
participating no action is taken.</li>
<li>If the candidate replies they no longer require commit
access then their access is removed.</li>
<li>If the candidate can not be reached within 2 months of the
second attempting to contact them, access is removed.</li>
<li>In any case, where access is removed, this fact is published
through an email to all existing committers (including the
candidate for removal).</li>
</ul>

<p>The more difficult situation is a committer who is behaving in a
manner that is viewed as detrimental to the future of the project
by other committers. This is a delicate situation with the
potential for the creation of division within the greater
community and should be handled with care. The process in this
case is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss the behavior of concern with the individual privately and
explain why you believe it is detrimental to the project. Stick
to the facts and keep the email professional. Avoid personal
attacks and the temptation to hypothesize about unknowable
information such as the other's motivations. Make it clear that
you would prefer not to discuss the behavior more widely but will
have to raise it with other contributors if it does not change.
Ideally the behavior is eliminated and no further action is
required. If not,</li>
<li>Start an email thread with all committers, including the source
of the behavior, describing the behavior and the reason it is
detrimental to the project. The message should have the same
tone as the private discussion and should generally repeat the
same points covered in that discussion. The person whose
behavior is being questioned should not be surprised by anything
presented in this discussion. Ideally the wider discussion
provides more perspective to all participants and the issue is
resolved. If not,</li>
<li>Start an email thread with all committers except the source of
the detrimental behavior requesting a vote on revocation of
commit rights. Cite the discussion among all committers and
describe all the reasons why it was not resolved satisfactorily.
This email should be carefully written with the knowledge that the
reasoning it contains may be published to the larger community
to justify the decision.</li>
<li>Each committer may vote yes, no, or abstain by replying to the
email thread. A failure to reply is an implicit abstention.</li>
<li>After all votes have been collected or a reasonable time has
elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days)
the votes are evaluated. For the request to revoke commit access
for the candidate to pass it must receive yes votes from two
thirds of the existing committers.</li>
<li>anyone that votes no must provide their reasoning, and</li>
<li>if the proposal passes then counter-arguments for the reasoning in
no votes should also be documented along with the initial reasons
the revocation was proposed. Ideally there should be no new
counter-arguments supplied in a no vote as all concerns should
have surfaced in the discussion before the vote.</li>
<li>The original person to propose revocation summarizes the result
of the vote in an email to all existing committers excepting the
candidate for removal.</li>
<li>If the vote to revoke commit access passes, access is removed and
the candidate for revocation is informed of that fact and the
reasons for it as documented in the email requesting the
revocation vote.</li>
<li>Ideally the revoked committer peacefully leaves the community
and no further action is required. However, there is a
distinct possibility that he/she will try to generate support
for his/her point of view within the larger community. In
this case the reasoning for removing commit access as
described in the request for a vote will be published to the
community.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changing the Policy</h2>

<p>The process for changing the policy is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Propose the changes to the policy in an email to all current
committers and request discussion.</li>
<li>After an appropriate period of discussion (a few days) update
the proposal based on feedback if required and resend it to all
current committers with a request for a formal vote.</li>
<li>After all votes have been collected or a reasonable time has
elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days)
the votes are evaluated. For the request to modify the policy to
pass it must receive yes votes from two thirds of the existing
committers.</li>
</ul>
