.SH NAME
ovn-nb \- OVN_Northbound database schema
.PP
This database is the interface between OVN and the cloud management system
(CMS), such as OpenStack, running above it\[char46]  The CMS produces almost all of
the contents of the database\[char46]  The \fBovn\-northd\fR program
monitors the database contents, transforms it, and stores it into the \fBOVN_Southbound\fR database\[char46]
.PP
We generally speak of ``the\(cq\(cq CMS, but one can imagine scenarios in
which multiple CMSes manage different parts of an OVN deployment\[char46]
.SS "External IDs"
.PP
Each of the tables in this database contains a special column, named
\fBexternal_ids\fR\[char46]  This column has the same form and purpose each
place it appears\[char46]
.RS
.TP
\fBexternal_ids\fR: map of string-string pairs
Key-value pairs for use by the CMS\[char46]  The CMS might use certain pairs, for
example, to identify entities in its own configuration that correspond to
those in this database\[char46]

.SH "TABLE RELATIONSHIPS"
.PP
The following diagram shows the relationship among tables in the
database.  Each node represents a table.  Tables that are part of the
``root set'' are shown with double borders.  Each edge leads from the
table that contains it and points to the table that its value
represents.  Edges are labeled with their column names, followed by a
constraint on the number of allowed values: \fB?\fR for zero or one,
\fB*\fR for zero or more, \fB+\fR for one or more.  Thick lines
represent strong references; thin lines represent weak references.

The logical port name\[char46]
.IP
For entities (VMs or containers) that are spawned in the hypervisor,
the name used here must match those used in the \fBexternal_ids:iface-id\fR in the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR database\(cqs \fBInterface\fR table, because hypervisors use \fBexternal_ids:iface-id\fR as a lookup
key to identify the network interface of that entity\[char46]
.IP
For containers that are spawned inside a VM, the name can be
any unique identifier\[char46]  In such a case, \fBparent_name\fR
must be populated\[char46]
.IP "\fBtype\fR: string"
Specify a type for this logical port\[char46]  Logical ports can be used to model
other types of connectivity into an OVN logical switch\[char46]  Leaving this column
blank maintains the default logical port behavior\[char46]
.IP
There are no other logical port types implemented yet\[char46]
.IP "\fBoptions\fR: map of string-string pairs"
This column provides key/value settings specific to the logical port
\fBtype\fR\[char46]
.IP "\fBparent_name\fR: optional string"
When \fBname\fR identifies the interface of a container
spawned inside a tenant VM, this column represents the VM interface
through which the container interface sends its network traffic\[char46]
The name used here must match those used in the \fBexternal_ids:iface-id\fR in the
\fBOpen_vSwitch\fR table, because hypervisors in this case use
\fBexternal_ids:iface-id\fR as a lookup key to identify the network interface
of the tenant VM\[char46]
.IP "\fBtag\fR: optional integer, in range 0 to 4,095"
When \fBname\fR identifies the interface of a container
spawned inside a tenant VM, this column identifies the VLAN tag in
the network traffic associated with that container\(cqs network interface\[char46]
When there are multiple container interfaces inside a VM, all of
them send their network traffic through a single VM network interface and
this value helps OVN identify the correct container interface\[char46]
.IP "\fBup\fR: optional boolean"
This column is populated by \fBovn\-northd\fR, rather than by
the CMS plugin as is most of this database\[char46]  When a logical port is bound
to a physical location in the OVN Southbound database \fBBinding\fR table, \fBovn\-northd\fR
sets this column to \fBtrue\fR; otherwise, or if the port
becomes unbound later, it sets it to \fBfalse\fR\[char46]  This
allows the CMS to wait for a VM\(cqs (or container\(cqs) networking to
become active before it allows the VM (or container) to start\[char46]
.IP "\fBenabled\fR: optional boolean"
This column is used to administratively set port state\[char46]  If this column is
empty or is set to \fBtrue\fR, the port is enabled\[char46]  If this column
is set to \fBfalse\fR, the port is disabled\[char46]  A disabled port has all
ingress and egress traffic dropped\[char46]

The logical port\(cqs own Ethernet address or addresses, each in the form
\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR:\fIxx\fR\[char46]
Like a physical Ethernet NIC, a logical port ordinarily has a single
fixed Ethernet address\[char46]  The string \fBunknown\fR is also allowed
to indicate that the logical port has an unknown set of (additional)
source addresses\[char46]
.IP "\fBport_security\fR: set of strings"
A set of L2 (Ethernet) addresses
from which the logical port is allowed to send packets and to which it
is allowed to receive packets\[char46]  If this column is empty, all addresses

addressed to multicast and broadcast addresses\[char46]
