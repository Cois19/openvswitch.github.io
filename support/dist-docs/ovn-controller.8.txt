NAME
       ovn-controller - Open Virtual Network local controller

SYNOPSIS
       ovn-controller [options] [ovs-database]

DESCRIPTION
       ovn-controller is the local controller daemon for OVN, the Open Virtual
       Network. It connects up to the OVN Southbound database (see  ovn-sb(5))
       over  the  OVSDB  protocol,  and down to the Open vSwitch database (see
       ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)) over the OVSDB protocol and to ovs-vswitchd(8)
       via OpenFlow. Each hypervisor and software gateway in an OVN deployment
       runs its own independent copy of ovn-controller; thus, ovn-controller’s
       downward  connections  are machine-local and do not run over a physical
       network.

CONFIGURATION
       ovn-controller retrieves most of its configuration information from the
       local  Open  vSwitch’s  ovsdb-server  instance. The default location is
       db.sock in the local Open vSwitch’s "run" directory. It may be overrid‐
       den  by  specifying  the  ovs-database argument in one of the following
       forms:

              ·      ssl:ip:port

                     The specified SSL port on the host at the given ip, which
                     must  be  expressed  as an IP address (not a DNS name) in
                     IPv4 or IPv6 address format. If ip is  an  IPv6  address,
                     then  wrap ip with square brackets, e.g.: ssl:[::1]:6640.
                     The --private-key, --certificate and either of  --ca-cert
                     or  --bootstrap-ca-cert  options  are mandatory when this
                     form is used.

              ·      tcp:ip:port

                     Connect to the given TCP port on ip, where ip can be IPv4
                     or  IPv6  address. If ip is an IPv6 address, then wrap ip
                     with square brackets, e.g.: tcp:[::1]:6640.

              ·      unix:file

                     On POSIX, connect to the Unix domain server socket  named
                     file.

                     On  Windows,  connect to a localhost TCP port whose value
                     is written in file.

       ovn-controller assumes it gets configuration information from the  fol‐
       lowing keys in the Open_vSwitch table of the local OVS instance:

              external_ids:system-id
                     The chassis name to use in the Chassis table.

              external_ids:hostname
                     The hostname to use in the Chassis table.

              external_ids:ovn-bridge
                     The   integration  bridge  to  which  logical  ports  are
                     attached. The default is br-int. If this bridge does  not
                     exist  when  ovn-controller  starts,  it  will be created
                     automatically with the default configuration suggested in
                     ovn-architecture(7).

              external_ids:ovn-remote
                     The  OVN  database that this system should connect to for
                     its configuration, in one of the  same  forms  documented
                     above for the ovs-database.

              external_ids:ovn-remote-probe-interval
                     The  inactivity  probe  interval of the connection to the
                     OVN database, in milliseconds. If the value is  zero,  it
                     disables the connection keepalive feature.

                     If  the  value  is  nonzero,  then it will be forced to a
                     value of at least 1000 ms.

              external_ids:ovn-encap-type
                     The encapsulation type that a chassis should use to  con‐
                     nect  to  this  node. Multiple encapsulation types may be
                     specified with a comma-separated list. Each listed encap‐
                     sulation type will be paired with ovn-encap-ip.

                     Supported  tunnel  types  for  connecting hypervisors are
                     geneve and stt. Gateways may use geneve, vxlan, or stt.

                     Due to the limited amount of metadata in vxlan, the capa‐
                     bilities  and  performance  of connected gateways will be
                     reduced versus other tunnel formats.

              external_ids:ovn-encap-ip
                     The IP address that a chassis should use  to  connect  to
                     this  node  using encapsulation types specified by exter‐
                     nal_ids:ovn-encap-type.

              external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings
                     A list of key-value pairs that  map  a  physical  network
                     name  to a local ovs bridge that provides connectivity to
                     that network. An example value mapping two physical  net‐
                     work   names   to   two   ovs  bridges  would  be:  phys‐
                     net1:br-eth0,physnet2:br-eth1.

              external_ids:ovn-encap-csum
                     ovn-encap-csum indicates that encapsulation checksums can
                     be  transmitted and received with reasonable performance.
                     It is a hint to senders transmitting data to this chassis
                     that  they  should use checksums to protect OVN metadata.
                     Set to true to enable or false to disable.  Depending  on
                     the  capabilities of the network interface card, enabling
                     encapsulation checksum may  incur  performance  loss.  In
                     such cases, encapsulation checksums can be disabled.

       ovn-controller  reads  the following values from the Open_vSwitch data‐
       base of the local OVS instance:

              datapath-type from Bridge table
                     This value is read from local OVS integration bridge  row
                     of  Bridge  table and populated in external_ids:datapath-
                     type of the Chassis table in the OVN_Southbound database.

              iface-types from Open_vSwitch table
                     This value is populated  in  external_ids:iface-types  of
                     the Chassis table in the OVN_Southbound database.

OPEN VSWITCH DATABASE USAGE
       ovn-controller  uses  a number of external_ids keys in the Open vSwitch
       database to keep track of ports and interfaces. For  proper  operation,
       users should not change or clear these keys:

              external_ids:ovn-chassis-id in the Port table
                     The  presence of this key identifies a tunnel port within
                     the integration bridge as one created  by  ovn-controller
                     to reach a remote chassis. Its value is the chassis ID of
                     the remote chassis.

              external_ids:ct-zone-* in the Bridge table
                     Logical ports and gateway routers are assigned a  connec‐
                     tion  tracking  zone  by ovn-controller for stateful ser‐
                     vices. To keep state across restarts  of  ovn-controller,
                     these  keys are stored in the integration bridge’s Bridge
                     table. The name contains a prefix of ct-zone- followed by
                     the  name  of  the  logical port or gateway router’s zone
                     key. The value for this key identifies the zone used  for
                     this port.

              external_ids:ovn-localnet-port in the Port table
                     The  presence  of this key identifies a patch port as one
                     created by  ovn-controller  to  connect  the  integration
                     bridge and another bridge to implement a localnet logical
                     port. Its value is the name of the logical port with type
                     set  to  localnet  that  the  port implements. See exter‐
                     nal_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings, above, for more information.

                     Each localnet logical port is implemented as  a  pair  of
                     patch ports, one in the integration bridge, one in a dif‐
                     ferent  bridge,  with  the  same  external_ids:ovn-local‐
                     net-port value.

              external_ids:ovn-l2gateway-port in the Port table
                     The  presence  of this key identifies a patch port as one
                     created by  ovn-controller  to  connect  the  integration
                     bridge  and another bridge to implement a l2gateway logi‐
                     cal port. Its value is the name of the logical port  with
                     type  set  to  l2gateway  that  the  port implements. See
                     external_ids:ovn-bridge-mappings, above, for more  infor‐
                     mation.

                     Each  l2gateway  logical port is implemented as a pair of
                     patch ports, one in the integration bridge, one in a dif‐
                     ferent  bridge,  with  the  same external_ids:ovn-l2gate‐
                     way-port value.

              external-ids:ovn-l3gateway-port in the Port table
                     This key identifies  a  patch  port  as  one  created  by
                     ovn-controller to implement a l3gateway logical port. Its
                     value is the name of the logical port with  type  set  to
                     l3gateway.  This patch port is similar to the OVN logical
                     patch port, except that l3gateway port can only be  bound
                     to a paticular chassis.

              external-ids:ovn-logical-patch-port in the Port table
                     This  key  identifies  a  patch  port  as  one created by
                     ovn-controller to implement an  OVN  logical  patch  port
                     within  the  integration bridge. Its value is the name of
                     the OVN logical patch port that it implements.

RUNTIME MANAGEMENT COMMANDS
       ovs-appctl can send commands to a running ovn-controller  process.  The
       currently supported commands are described below.

              exit   Causes ovn-controller to gracefully terminate.

              ct-zone-list
                     Lists each local logical port and its connection tracking
                     zone.

              inject-pkt microflow
                     Injects  microflow  into  the  connected   Open   vSwitch
                     instance.  microflow must contain an ingress logical port
                     (inport argument) that is present  on  the  Open  vSwitch
                     instance.

                     The  microflow  argument  describes the packet whose for‐
                     warding is to be simulated, in the syntax of an OVN logi‐
                     cal  expression,  as  described  in ovn-sb(5), to express
                     constraints. The parser  understands  prerequisites;  for
                     example, if the expression refers to ip4.src, there is no
                     need to explicitly state ip4 or eth.type == 0x800.
