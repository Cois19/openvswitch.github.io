<p>This document describes how to integrate Open vSwitch onto a new platform to
expose the state of the switch and attached devices for centralized control.
(If you are looking to port the switching components of Open vSwitch to a new
platform, please see the PORTING document.)  The focus of this guide is on
hypervisors, but many of the interfaces are useful for hardware switches, as
well.  The XenServer integration is the most mature implementation, so most of
the examples are drawn from it.</p>
<p>The externally visible interface to this integration is platform-agnostic.  We
encourage anyone who integrates Open vSwitch to use the same interface, because
keeping a uniform interface means that controllers require less customization
for individual platforms (and perhaps no customization at all).</p>
<p>Integration centers around the Open vSwitch database and mostly involves the
<tt class="docutils literal">external_ids</tt> columns in several of the tables.  These columns are not
interpreted by Open vSwitch itself.  Instead, they provide information to a
controller that permits it to associate a database record with a more
meaningful entity.  In contrast, the <tt class="docutils literal">other_config</tt> column is used to
configure behavior of the switch.  The main job of the integrator, then, is to
ensure that these values are correctly populated and maintained.</p>
<p>An integrator sets the columns in the database by talking to the ovsdb-server
daemon.  A few of the columns can be set during startup by calling the ovs-ctl
tool from inside the startup scripts.  The <tt class="docutils literal">xenserver/etc_init.d_openvswitch</tt>
script provides examples of its use, and the ovs-ctl(8) manpage contains
complete documentation.  At runtime, ovs-vsctl can be be used to set columns in
the database.  The script <tt class="docutils literal">xenserver/etc_xensource_scripts_vif</tt> contains
examples of its use, and ovs-vsctl(8) manpage contains complete documentation.</p>
<p>Python and C bindings to the database are provided if deeper integration with a
program are needed.  The XenServer ovs-xapi-sync daemon
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">xenserver/usr_share_openvswitch_scripts_ovs-xapi-sync</span></tt>) provides an example
of using the Python bindings.  More information on the python bindings is
available at <tt class="docutils literal">python/ovs/db/idl.py</tt>.  Information on the C bindings is
available at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">lib/ovsdb-idl.h</span></tt>.</p>

architecture:</p>

<p>A description of the most relevant fields for integration follows.  By setting
these values, controllers are able to understand the network and manage it more
dynamically and precisely.  For more details about the database and each
individual column, please refer to the ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) manpage.</p>
<div class="section" id="open-vswitch-table">
<h1><tt class="docutils literal">Open_vSwitch</tt> table</h1>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">Open_vSwitch</tt> table describes the switch as a whole.  The
<tt class="docutils literal">system_type</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">system_version</tt> columns identify the platform to the
controller.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">external_ids:system-id</span></tt> key uniquely identifies the
physical host.  In XenServer, the system-id will likely be the same as the UUID
returned by <tt class="docutils literal">xe <span class="pre">host-list</span></tt>. This key allows controllers to distinguish
between multiple hypervisors.</p>
<p>Most of this configuration can be done with the ovs-ctl command at startup.
For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ctl --system-type=&quot;XenServer&quot; --system-version=&quot;6.0.0-50762p&quot; \
    --system-id=&quot;${UUID}&quot; &quot;${other_options}&quot; start
</pre>
<p>Alternatively, the ovs-vsctl command may be used to set a particular value at
runtime.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl set open_vswitch . external-ids:system-id='&quot;${UUID}&quot;'
</pre>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">other_config:enable-statistics</span></tt> key may be set to <tt class="docutils literal">true</tt> to have OVS
populate the database with statistics (e.g., number of CPUs, memory, system
load) for the controller's use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bridge-table">
<h1>Bridge table</h1>
<p>The Bridge table describes individual bridges within an Open vSwitch instance.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">external-ids:bridge-id</span></tt> key uniquely identifies a particular bridge.  In
XenServer, this will likely be the same as the UUID returned by <tt class="docutils literal">xe
<span class="pre">network-list</span></tt> for that particular bridge.</p>
<p>For example, to set the identifier for bridge &quot;br0&quot;, the following command can
be used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 external-ids:bridge-id='&quot;${UUID}&quot;'
</pre>
<p>The MAC address of the bridge may be manually configured by setting it with the
<tt class="docutils literal">other_config:hwaddr</tt> key.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl set Bridge br0 other_config:hwaddr=&quot;12:34:56:78:90:ab&quot;
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interface-table">
<h1>Interface table</h1>
<p>The Interface table describes an interface under the control of Open vSwitch.
The <tt class="docutils literal">external_ids</tt> column contains keys that are used to provide additional
information about the interface:</p>
<p>attached-mac</p>
<blockquote>
This field contains the MAC address of the device attached to the interface.
On a hypervisor, this is the MAC address of the interface as seen inside a
VM.  It does not necessarily correlate to the host-side MAC address.  For
example, on XenServer, the MAC address on a VIF in the hypervisor is always
FE:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF, but inside the VM a normal MAC address is seen.</blockquote>
<p>iface-id</p>
<blockquote>
This field uniquely identifies the interface.  In hypervisors, this allows
the controller to follow VM network interfaces as VMs migrate.  A well-chosen
identifier should also allow an administrator or a controller to associate
the interface with the corresponding object in the VM management system.  For
example, the Open vSwitch integration with XenServer by default uses the
XenServer assigned UUID for a VIF record as the iface-id.</blockquote>
<p>iface-status</p>
<blockquote>
In a hypervisor, there are situations where there are multiple interface
choices for a single virtual ethernet interface inside a VM.  Valid values
are &quot;active&quot; and &quot;inactive&quot;.  A complete description is available in the
ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5) manpage.</blockquote>
<p>vm-id</p>
<blockquote>
This field uniquely identifies the VM to which this interface belongs.  A
single VM may have multiple interfaces attached to it.</blockquote>
<p>As in the previous tables, the ovs-vsctl command may be used to configure the
values.  For example, to set the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">iface-id</span></tt> on eth0, the following command
can be used:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl set Interface eth0 external-ids:iface-id='&quot;${UUID}&quot;'
</pre>
