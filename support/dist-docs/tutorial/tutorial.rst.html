<p>Many tutorials cover the basics of OpenFlow.  This is not such a tutorial.
Rather, a knowledge of the basics of OpenFlow is a prerequisite.  If you do not
already understand how an OpenFlow flow table works, please go read a basic
tutorial and then continue reading here afterward.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand the basics of Open vSwitch before you begin.
If you have never used ovs-vsctl or ovs-ofctl before, you should learn a little
about them before proceeding.</p>
<p>Most of the features covered in this tutorial are Open vSwitch extensions to
OpenFlow.  Also, most of the features in this tutorial are specific to the
software Open vSwitch implementation.  If you are using an Open vSwitch port to
an ASIC-based hardware switch, this tutorial will not help you.</p>
<p>This tutorial does not cover every aspect of the features that it mentions.
You can find the details elsewhere in the Open vSwitch documentation,
especially <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-ofctl(8)</span></tt> and the comments in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">include/openflow/nicira-ext.h</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">include/openvswitch/meta-flow.h</span></tt>
header files.</p>
<div class="section" id="getting-started">
<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>This is a hands-on tutorial.  To get the most out of it, you will need Open
vSwitch binaries.  You do not, on the other hand, need any physical networking
hardware or even supervisor privilege on your system.  Instead, we will use a
script called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt>, which accompanies the tutorial, that constructs
a software simulated network environment based on Open vSwitch.</p>
<p>You can use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt> three ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you have already installed Open vSwitch on your system, then you should be
able to just run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt> from this directory without any options.</li>
<li>If you have not installed Open vSwitch (and you do not want to install it),
then you can build Open vSwitch according to the instructions in the
<a class="reference external" href="INSTALL.rst">installation guide</a>, without installing it.  Then run
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">./ovs-sandbox</span> <span class="pre">-b</span> DIRECTORY</tt> from this directory, substituting the Open
vSwitch build directory for <tt class="docutils literal">DIRECTORY</tt>.</li>
<li>As a slight variant on the latter, you can run <tt class="docutils literal">make sandbox</tt> from an Open
vSwitch build directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you run <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt>, it does the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>CAUTION:</strong> Deletes any subdirectory of the current directory named
&quot;sandbox&quot; and any files in that directory.</li>
<li>Creates a new directory &quot;sandbox&quot; in the current directory.</li>
<li>Sets up special environment variables that ensure that Open vSwitch programs
will look inside the &quot;sandbox&quot; directory instead of in the Open vSwitch
installation directory.</li>
<li>If you are using a built but not installed Open vSwitch, installs the Open
vSwitch manpages in a subdirectory of &quot;sandbox&quot; and adjusts the <tt class="docutils literal">MANPATH</tt>
environment variable to point to this directory.  This means that you can
use, for example, <tt class="docutils literal">man <span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span></tt> to see a manpage for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span></tt>
program that you built.</li>
<li>Creates an empty Open vSwitch configuration database under &quot;sandbox&quot;.</li>
<li>Starts <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovsdb-server</span></tt> running under &quot;sandbox&quot;.</li>
<li>Starts <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vswitchd</span></tt> running under &quot;sandbox&quot;, passing special options
that enable a special &quot;dummy&quot; mode for testing.</li>
<li>Starts a nested interactive shell inside &quot;sandbox&quot;.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, you can run all the usual Open vSwitch utilities from the nested
shell environment.  You can, for example, use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span></tt> to create a bridge:</p>
<blockquote>
$ ovs-vsctl add-br br0</blockquote>
<p>From Open vSwitch's perspective, the bridge that you create this way is as real
as any other.  You can, for example, connect it to an OpenFlow controller or
use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-ofctl</span></tt> to examine and modify it and its OpenFlow flow table.  On the
other hand, the bridge is not visible to the operating system's network stack,
so <tt class="docutils literal">ifconfig</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal">ip</tt> cannot see it or affect it, which means that
utilities like <tt class="docutils literal">ping</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">tcpdump</tt> will not work either.  (That has its
good side, too: you can't screw up your computer's network stack by
manipulating a sandboxed OVS.)</p>
<p>When you're done using OVS from the sandbox, exit the nested shell (by entering
the &quot;exit&quot; shell command or pressing Control+D).  This will kill the daemons
that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt> started, but it leaves the &quot;sandbox&quot; directory and its
contents in place.</p>
<p>The sandbox directory contains log files for the Open vSwitch dameons.  You can
examine them while you're running in the sandboxed environment or after you
exit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-gdb">
<h1>Using GDB</h1>
<p>GDB support is not required to go through the tutorial. It is added in case
user wants to explore the internals of OVS programs.</p>
<p>GDB can already be used to debug any running process, with the usual
<tt class="docutils literal">gdb &lt;program&gt; <span class="pre">&lt;process-id&gt;</span></tt> command.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt> also has a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-g</span></tt> option for launching ovs-vswitchd under GDB.
This option can be handy for setting break points before ovs-vswitchd runs, or
for catching early segfaults. Similarly, a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-d</span></tt> option can be used to run
ovsdb-server under GDB. Both options can be specified at the same time.</p>
<p>In addition, a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-e</span></tt> option also launches ovs-vswitchd under GDB. However,
instead of displaying a <tt class="docutils literal">gdb&gt;</tt> prompt and waiting for user input,
ovs-vswitchd will start to execute immediately. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-r</span></tt> option is the
corresponding option for running ovsdb-server under gdb with immediate
execution.</p>
<p>To avoid GDB mangling with the sandbox sub shell terminal, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt>
starts a new xterm to run each GDB session.  For systems that do not support X
windows, GDB support is effectively disabled.</p>
<p>When launching sandbox through the build tree's make file, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-g</span></tt> option
can be passed via the <tt class="docutils literal">SANDBOXFLAGS</tt> environment variable.  <tt class="docutils literal">make sandbox
<span class="pre">SANDBOXFLAGS=-g</span></tt> will start the sandbox with ovs-vswitchd running under GDB in
its own xterm if X is available.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the power of Open vSwitch flow
tables.  The tutorial works through the implementation of a MAC-learning switch
with VLAN trunk and access ports.  Outside of the Open vSwitch features that we
will discuss, OpenFlow provides at least two ways to implement such a switch:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>An OpenFlow controller to implement MAC learning in a &quot;reactive&quot; fashion.
Whenever a new MAC appears on the switch, or a MAC moves from one switch
port to another, the controller adjusts the OpenFlow flow table to match.</li>
<li>The &quot;normal&quot; action.  OpenFlow defines this action to submit a packet to
&quot;the traditional non-OpenFlow pipeline of the switch&quot;.  That is, if a flow
uses this action, then the packets in the flow go through the switch in the
same way that they would if OpenFlow was not configured on the switch.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these approaches has unfortunate pitfalls.  In the first approach,
using an OpenFlow controller to implement MAC learning, has a significant cost
in terms of network bandwidth and latency.  It also makes the controller more
difficult to scale to large numbers of switches, which is especially important
in environments with thousands of hypervisors (each of which contains a virtual
OpenFlow switch).  MAC learning at an OpenFlow controller also behaves poorly
if the OpenFlow controller fails, slows down, or becomes unavailable due to
network problems.</p>
<p>The second approach, using the &quot;normal&quot; action, has different problems.  First,
little about the &quot;normal&quot; action is standardized, so it behaves differently on
switches from different vendors, and the available features and how those
features are configured (usually not through OpenFlow) varies widely.  Second,
&quot;normal&quot; does not work well with other OpenFlow actions.  It is
&quot;all-or-nothing&quot;, with little potential to adjust its behavior slightly or to
compose it with other features.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scenario">
<h1>Scenario</h1>
<p>We will construct Open vSwitch flow tables for a VLAN-capable,
MAC-learning switch that has four ports:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>p1</dt>
<dd>a trunk port that carries all VLANs, on OpenFlow port 1.</dd>
<dt>p2</dt>
<dd>an access port for VLAN 20, on OpenFlow port 2.</dd>
<dt>p3, p4</dt>
<dd>both access ports for VLAN 30, on OpenFlow ports 3 and 4, respectively.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The ports' names are not significant.  You could call them eth1 through eth4,
or any other names you like.</p>
</div>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">An OpenFlow switch always has a &quot;local&quot; port as well.  This scenario won't
use the local port.</p>
</div>
<p>Our switch design will consist of five main flow tables, each of which
implements one stage in the switch pipeline:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Table 0</dt>
<dd>Admission control.</dd>
<dt>Table 1</dt>
<dd>VLAN input processing.</dd>
<dt>Table 2</dt>
<dd>Learn source MAC and VLAN for ingress port.</dd>
<dt>Table 3</dt>
<dd>Look up learned port for destination MAC and VLAN.</dd>
<dt>Table 4</dt>
<dd>Output processing.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The section below describes how to set up the scenario, followed by a section
for each OpenFlow table.</p>
<p>You can cut and paste the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-ofctl</span></tt> commands in each of
the sections below into your <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt> shell.  They are also available as
shell scripts in this directory, named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t-setup</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t-stage0</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t-stage1</span></tt>,
..., <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t-stage4</span></tt>.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-appctl</span></tt> test commands are intended for cutting
and pasting and are not supplied separately.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>To get started, start <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-sandbox</span></tt>.  Inside the interactive shell that it
starts, run this command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl add-br br0 -- set Bridge br0 fail-mode=secure
</pre>
<p>This command creates a new bridge &quot;br0&quot; and puts &quot;br0&quot; into so-called
&quot;fail-secure&quot; mode.  For our purpose, this just means that the OpenFlow flow
table starts out empty.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If we did not do this, then the flow table would start out with a single flow
that executes the &quot;normal&quot; action.  We could use that feature to yield a
switch that behaves the same as the switch we are currently building, but
with the caveats described under &quot;Motivation&quot; above.)</p>
</div>
<p>The new bridge has only one port on it so far, the &quot;local port&quot; br0.  We need
to add <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">p2</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">p3</tt>, and <tt class="docutils literal">p4</tt>.  A shell <tt class="docutils literal">for</tt> loop is one way to
do it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
for i in 1 2 3 4; do
    ovs-vsctl add-port br0 p$i -- set Interface p$i ofport_request=$i
    ovs-ofctl mod-port br0 p$i up
done
</pre>
<p>In addition to adding a port, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span></tt> command above sets its
<tt class="docutils literal">ofport_request</tt> column to ensure that port <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt> is assigned OpenFlow port
1, <tt class="docutils literal">p2</tt> is assigned OpenFlow port 2, and so on.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">We could omit setting the ofport_request and let Open vSwitch choose port
numbers for us, but it's convenient for the purposes of this tutorial because
we can talk about OpenFlow port 1 and know that it corresponds to <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt>.</p>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-ofctl</span></tt> command above brings up the simulated interfaces, which are
down initially, using an OpenFlow request.  The effect is similar to <tt class="docutils literal">ifconfig
up</tt>, but the sandbox's interfaces are not visible to the operating system and
therefore <tt class="docutils literal">ifconfig</tt> would not affect them.</p>
<p>We have not configured anything related to VLANs or MAC learning.  That's
because we're going to implement those features in the flow table.</p>
<p>To see what we've done so far to set up the scenario, you can run a command
like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span> show</tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-ofctl</span> show br0</tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementing-table-0-admission-control">
<h1>Implementing Table 0: Admission control</h1>
<p>Table 0 is where packets enter the switch.  We use this stage to discard
packets that for one reason or another are invalid.  For example, packets with
a multicast source address are not valid, so we can add a flow to drop them at
ingress to the switch with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
    &quot;table=0, dl_src=01:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00, actions=drop&quot;
</pre>
<p>A switch should also not forward IEEE 802.1D Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
packets, so we can also add a flow to drop those and other packets with
reserved multicast protocols:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
    &quot;table=0, dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:f0, actions=drop&quot;
</pre>
<p>We could add flows to drop other protocols, but these demonstrate the pattern.</p>
<p>We need one more flow, with a priority lower than the default, so that flows
that don't match either of the &quot;drop&quot; flows we added above go on to pipeline
stage 1 in OpenFlow table 1:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 &quot;table=0, priority=0, actions=resubmit(,1)&quot;
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The &quot;resubmit&quot; action is an Open vSwitch extension to OpenFlow.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-table-0">
<h1>Testing Table 0</h1>
<p>If we were using Open vSwitch to set up a physical or a virtual switch, then we
would naturally test it by sending packets through it one way or another,
perhaps with common network testing tools like <tt class="docutils literal">ping</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">tcpdump</tt> or more
specialized tools like Scapy.  That's difficult with our simulated switch,
since it's not visible to the operating system.</p>
<p>But our simulated switch has a few specialized testing tools.  The most
powerful of these tools is <tt class="docutils literal">ofproto/trace</tt>.  Given a switch and the
specification of a flow, <tt class="docutils literal">ofproto/trace</tt> shows, step-by-step, how such a flow
would be treated as it goes through the switch.</p>
<div class="section" id="example-1">
<h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>Try this command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 in_port=1,dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:05
</pre>
<p>The output should look something like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Flow: metadata=0,in_port=1,vlan_tci=0x0000,dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:00,dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:05,dl_type=0x0000
Rule: table=0 cookie=0 dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:00/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:f0
OpenFlow actions=drop

Final flow: unchanged
Datapath actions: drop
</pre>
<p>The first block of lines describes an OpenFlow table lookup.  The first line
shows the fields used for the table lookup (which is mostly zeros because
that's the default if we don't specify everything).  The second line gives the
OpenFlow flow that the fields matched (called a &quot;rule&quot; because that is the name
used inside Open vSwitch for an OpenFlow flow).  In this case, we see that this
packet that has a reserved multicast destination address matches the rule that
drops those packets.  The third line gives the rule's OpenFlow actions.</p>
<p>The second block of lines summarizes the results, which are not very
interesting here.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example-2">
<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Try another command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 in_port=1,dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:10
</pre>
<p>The output should be:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Flow: metadata=0,in_port=1,vlan_tci=0x0000,dl_src=00:00:00:00:00:00,dl_dst=01:80:c2:00:00:10,dl_type=0x0000

Resubmitted  odp: drop
No match

Final flow: unchanged
Datapath actions: drop
</pre>
<p>This time the flow we handed to <tt class="docutils literal">ofproto/trace</tt> doesn't match any of our
&quot;drop&quot; rules, so it falls through to the low-priority &quot;resubmit&quot; rule, which we
see in the rule and the actions selected in the first block.  The &quot;resubmit&quot;
causes a second lookup in OpenFlow table 1, described by the additional block
of indented text in the output.  We haven't yet added any flows to OpenFlow
table 1, so no flow actually matches in the second lookup.  Therefore, the
packet is still actually dropped, which means that the externally observable
results would be identical to our first example.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementing-table-1-vlan-input-processing">
<h1>Implementing Table 1: VLAN Input Processing</h1>
<p>A packet that enters table 1 has already passed basic validation in table 0.
The purpose of table 1 is validate the packet's VLAN, based on the VLAN
configuration of the switch port through which the packet entered the switch.
We will also use it to attach a VLAN header to packets that arrive on an access
port, which allows later processing stages to rely on the packet's VLAN always
being part of the VLAN header, reducing special cases.</p>
<p>Let's start by adding a low-priority flow that drops all packets, before we add
flows that pass through acceptable packets.  You can think of this as a
&quot;default drop&quot; rule:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 &quot;table=1, priority=0, actions=drop&quot;
</pre>
<p>Our trunk port <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt>, on OpenFlow port 1, is an easy case.  <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt> accepts any
packet regardless of whether it has a VLAN header or what the VLAN was, so we
can add a flow that resubmits everything on input port 1 to the next table:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
    &quot;table=1, priority=99, in_port=1, actions=resubmit(,2)&quot;
</pre>
<p>On the access ports, we want to accept any packet that has no VLAN header, tag
it with the access port's VLAN number, and then pass it along to the next
stage:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flows br0 - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
table=1, priority=99, in_port=2, vlan_tci=0, actions=mod_vlan_vid:20, resubmit(,2)
table=1, priority=99, in_port=3, vlan_tci=0, actions=mod_vlan_vid:30, resubmit(,2)
table=1, priority=99, in_port=4, vlan_tci=0, actions=mod_vlan_vid:30, resubmit(,2)
EOF
</pre>
<p>We don't write any rules that match packets with 802.1Q that enter this stage
on any of the access ports, so the &quot;default drop&quot; rule we added earlier causes
them to be dropped, which is ordinarily what we want for access ports.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Another variation of access ports allows ingress of packets tagged with VLAN
0 (aka 802.1p priority tagged packets).  To allow such packets, replace

<h1>Implementing Table 2: MAC+VLAN Learning for Ingress Port</h1>
<p>This table allows the switch we're implementing to learn that the packet's
source MAC is located on the packet's ingress port in the packet's VLAN.</p>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">This table is a good example why table 1 added a VLAN tag to packets that
entered the switch through an access port.  We want to associate a MAC+VLAN
with a port regardless of whether the VLAN in question was originally part of
the packet or whether it was an assumed VLAN associated with an access port.</p>
</div>
<p>It only takes a single flow to do this.  The following command adds it:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
    &quot;table=2 actions=learn(table=10, NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI[0..11], \
                           NXM_OF_ETH_DST[]=NXM_OF_ETH_SRC[], \
                           load:NXM_OF_IN_PORT[]-&gt;NXM_NX_REG0[0..15]), \
                     resubmit(,3)&quot;
</pre>
<p>The &quot;learn&quot; action (an Open vSwitch extension to OpenFlow) modifies a flow
table based on the content of the flow currently being processed.  Here's how
you can interpret each part of the &quot;learn&quot; action above:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">table=10</tt></dt>
<dd>Modify flow table 10.  This will be the MAC learning table.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NXM_OF_VLAN_TCI[0..11]</span></tt></dt>
<dd>Make the flow that we add to flow table 10 match the same VLAN ID that the
packet we're currently processing contains.  This effectively scopes the
MAC learning entry to a single VLAN, which is the ordinary behavior for a
VLAN-aware switch.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">NXM_OF_ETH_DST[]=NXM_OF_ETH_SRC[]</span></tt></dt>
<dd>Make the flow that we add to flow table 10 match, as Ethernet destination,
the Ethernet source address of the packet we're currently processing.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load:NXM_OF_IN_PORT[]-&gt;NXM_NX_REG0[0..15]</span></tt></dt>
<dd>Whereas the preceding parts specify fields for the new flow to match, this
specifies an action for the flow to take when it matches.  The action is
for the flow to load the ingress port number of the current packet into
register 0 (a special field that is an Open vSwitch extension to OpenFlow).</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">A real use of &quot;learn&quot; for MAC learning would probably involve two additional
elements.  First, the &quot;learn&quot; action would specify a hard_timeout for the new
flow, to enable a learned MAC to eventually expire if no new packets were
seen from a given source within a reasonable interval.  Second, one would
usually want to limit resource consumption by using the Flow_Table table in
the Open vSwitch configuration database to specify a maximum number of flows
in table 10.</p>
</div>
<p>This definitely calls for examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-table-2">
<h1>Testing Table 2</h1>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Example 1</h2>
<p>Try the following test command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 \
    in_port=1,vlan_tci=20,dl_src=50:00:00:00:00:01 -generate
</pre>
<p>The output shows that &quot;learn&quot; was executed, but it isn't otherwise informative,
so we won't include it here.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-generate</span></tt> keyword is new.  Ordinarily, <tt class="docutils literal">ofproto/trace</tt> has no side
effects: &quot;output&quot; actions do not actually output packets, &quot;learn&quot; actions do
not actually modify the flow table, and so on.  With <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-generate</span></tt>, though,
<tt class="docutils literal">ofproto/trace</tt> does execute &quot;learn&quot; actions.  That's important now, because
we want to see the effect of the &quot;learn&quot; action on table 10.  You can see that
by running:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 table=10
</pre>
<p>which (omitting the <tt class="docutils literal">duration</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">idle_age</tt> fields, which will vary based
on how soon you ran this command after the previous one, as well as some other
uninteresting fields) prints something like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
NXST_FLOW reply (xid=0x4):

</pre>
<p>You can see that the packet coming in on VLAN <tt class="docutils literal">20</tt> with source MAC
<tt class="docutils literal">50:00:00:00:00:01</tt> became a flow that matches VLAN <tt class="docutils literal">20</tt> (written in
hexadecimal) and destination MAC <tt class="docutils literal">50:00:00:00:00:01</tt>.  The flow loads port
number <tt class="docutils literal">1</tt>, the input port for the flow we tested, into register 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id2">
<h2>Example 2</h2>
<p>Here's a second test command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 \
    in_port=2,dl_src=50:00:00:00:00:01 -generate
</pre>
<p>The flow that this command tests has the same source MAC and VLAN as example 1,
although the VLAN comes from an access port VLAN rather than an 802.1Q header.
If we again dump the flows for table 10 with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 table=10
</pre>
<p>then we see that the flow we saw previously has changed to indicate that the
learned port is port 2, as we would expect:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
NXST_FLOW reply (xid=0x4):

<div class="section" id="implementing-table-3-look-up-destination-port">
<h1>Implementing Table 3: Look Up Destination Port</h1>
<p>This table figures out what port we should send the packet to based on the
destination MAC and VLAN.  That is, if we've learned the location of the
destination (from table 2 processing some previous packet with that destination
as its source), then we want to send the packet there.</p>
<p>We need only one flow to do the lookup:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
    &quot;table=3 priority=50 actions=resubmit(,10), resubmit(,4)&quot;
</pre>
<p>The flow's first action resubmits to table 10, the table that the &quot;learn&quot;
action modifies.  As you saw previously, the learned flows in this table write
the learned port into register 0.  If the destination for our packet hasn't
been learned, then there will be no matching flow, and so the &quot;resubmit&quot; turns
into a no-op.  Because registers are initialized to 0, we can use a register 0
value of 0 in our next pipeline stage as a signal to flood the packet.</p>
<p>The second action resubmits to table 4, continuing to the next pipeline stage.</p>
<p>We can add another flow to skip the learning table lookup for multicast and
broadcast packets, since those should always be flooded:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 \
    &quot;table=3 priority=99 dl_dst=01:00:00:00:00:00/01:00:00:00:00:00 \
      actions=resubmit(,4)&quot;
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">We don't strictly need to add this flow, because multicast addresses will
never show up in our learning table.  (In turn, that's because we put a flow
into table 0 to drop packets that have a multicast source address.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="testing-table-3">
<h1>Testing Table 3</h1>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Here's a command that should cause OVS to learn that <tt class="docutils literal">f0:00:00:00:00:01</tt> is

</pre>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the output that shows (from the &quot;no match&quot; looking up
the resubmit to table 10) that the flow's destination was unknown:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

    Resubmitted  odp: drop
    No match
</pre>
<p>You can verify that the packet's source was learned two ways.  The most direct
way is to dump the learning table with:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0 table=10
</pre>
<p>which ought to show roughly the following, with extraneous details removed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
table=10, vlan_tci=0x0014/0x0fff,dl_dst=f0:00:00:00:00:01 actions=load:0x1-&gt;NXM_NX_REG0[0..15]
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">If you tried the examples for the previous step, or if you did some of your
own experiments, then you might see additional flows there.  These
additional flows are harmless.  If they bother you, then you can remove
them with <cite>ovs-ofctl del-flows br0 table=10</cite>.</p>
</div>
<p>The other way is to inject a packet to take advantage of the learning entry.
For example, we can inject a packet on p2 whose destination is the MAC address
that we just learned on p1:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>$ ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 </dt>
<dd>in_port=2,dl_src=90:00:00:00:00:01,dl_dst=f0:00:00:00:00:01 -generate</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an interesting excerpt from that command's output.  This group of lines
traces the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">resubmit(,10)</span></tt>, showing that the packet matched the learned flow
for the first MAC we used, loading the OpenFlow port number for the learned
port <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt> into register <tt class="docutils literal">0</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Resubmitted flow: unchanged
Resubmitted regs: reg0=0x0 reg1=0x0 reg2=0x0 reg3=0x0 reg4=0x0 reg5=0x0 reg6=0x0 reg7=0x0

OpenFlow actions=load:0x1-&gt;NXM_NX_REG0[0..15]
</pre>
<p>If you read the commands above carefully, then you might have noticed that they
simply have the Ethernet source and destination addresses exchanged.  That
means that if we now rerun the first <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-appctl</span></tt> command above, e.g.:</p>
<blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>$ ovs-appctl ofproto/trace br0 </dt>

</blockquote>
<p>then we see in the output that the destination has now been learned:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

<div class="section" id="implementing-table-4-output-processing">
<h1>Implementing Table 4: Output Processing</h1>
<p>At entry to stage 4, we know that register 0 contains either the desired output
port or is zero if the packet should be flooded.  We also know that the
packet's VLAN is in its 802.1Q header, even if the VLAN was implicit because
the packet came in on an access port.</p>
<p>The job of the final pipeline stage is to actually output packets.  The job is
trivial for output to our trunk port <tt class="docutils literal">p1</tt>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 &quot;table=4 reg0=1 actions=1&quot;
</pre>
<p>For output to the access ports, we just have to strip the VLAN header before
outputting the packet:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flows br0 - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
table=4 reg0=2 actions=strip_vlan,2
table=4 reg0=3 actions=strip_vlan,3
table=4 reg0=4 actions=strip_vlan,4
EOF
</pre>
<p>The only slightly tricky part is flooding multicast and broadcast packets and
unicast packets with unlearned destinations.  For those, we need to make sure
that we only output the packets to the ports that carry our packet's VLAN, and
that we include the 802.1Q header in the copy output to the trunk port but not
in copies output to access ports:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-ofctl add-flows br0 - &lt;&lt;'EOF'
table=4 reg0=0 priority=99 dl_vlan=20 actions=1,strip_vlan,2
table=4 reg0=0 priority=99 dl_vlan=30 actions=1,strip_vlan,3,4

EOF
</pre>
<div class="note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Our rules rely on the standard OpenFlow behavior that an output action will
not forward a packet back out the port it came in on.  That is, if a packet
comes in on p1, and we've learned that the packet's destination MAC is also
on p1, so that we end up with <tt class="docutils literal">actions=1</tt> as our actions, the switch will
not forward the packet back out its input port.  The
multicast/broadcast/unknown destination cases above also rely on this
behavior.</p>
