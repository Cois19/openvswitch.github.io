Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

=======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
- - - - - - -  Heading 1
~~~~~~~  Heading 2
+++++++  Heading 3
'''''''  Heading 4

Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well. -->
<p>We are eager to hear from users about problems that they have encountered with
Open vSwitch. This file documents how best to report bugs so as to ensure that
they can be fixed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Please report bugs by sending email to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bugs&#64;openvswitch.org">bugs&#64;openvswitch.org</a>.</p>
<p>For reporting security vulnerabilities, please read SECURITY.rst.</p>
<p>The most important parts of your bug report are the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What you did that make the problem appear.</li>
<li>What you expected to happen.</li>
<li>What actually happened.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please also include the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Open vSwitch version number (as output by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vswitchd</span> <span class="pre">--version</span></tt>).</li>
<li>The Git commit number (as output by <tt class="docutils literal">git <span class="pre">rev-parse</span> HEAD</tt>), if you built
from a Git snapshot.</li>
<li>Any local patches or changes you have applied (if any).</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are also handy sometimes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The kernel version on which Open vSwitch is running (from <tt class="docutils literal">/proc/version</tt>)
and the distribution and version number of your OS (e.g. &quot;Centos 5.0&quot;).</li>
<li>The contents of the vswitchd configuration database (usually
<tt class="docutils literal">/etc/openvswitch/conf.db</tt>).</li>
<li>The output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-dpctl</span> show</tt>.</li>
<li>If you have Open vSwitch configured to connect to an OpenFlow
controller, the output of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-ofctl</span> show &lt;bridge&gt;</tt> for each
<tt class="docutils literal">&lt;bridge&gt;</tt> configured in the vswitchd configuration database.</li>
<li>A fix or workaround, if you have one.</li>
<li>Any other information that you think might be relevant.</li>
</ul>
