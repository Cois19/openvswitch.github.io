<p>If you plan to configure Open vSwitch to connect across the network to an
OpenFlow controller, then we recommend that you build Open vSwitch with
OpenSSL. SSL support ensures integrity and confidentiality of the OpenFlow
connections, increasing network security.</p>
<p>This document describes how to configure an Open vSwitch to connect to an
OpenFlow controller over SSL.  Refer to the <a class="reference external" href="INSTALL.rst">general installation guide</a> for instructions on building Open vSwitch with SSL support.</p>
<p>Open vSwitch uses TLS version 1.0 or later (TLSv1), as specified by RFC 2246,
which is very similar to SSL version 3.0.  TLSv1 was released in January 1999,
so all current software and hardware should implement it.</p>
<p>This document assumes basic familiarity with public-key cryptography and
public-key infrastructure.</p>
<div class="section" id="ssl-concepts-for-openflow">
<h1>SSL Concepts for OpenFlow</h1>
<p>This section is an introduction to the public-key infrastructure architectures
that Open vSwitch supports for SSL authentication.</p>
<p>To connect over SSL, every Open vSwitch must have a unique private/public key
pair and a certificate that signs that public key.  Typically, the Open vSwitch
generates its own public/private key pair.  There are two common ways to obtain
a certificate for a switch:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Self-signed certificates: The Open vSwitch signs its certificate with its own
private key.  In this case, each switch must be individually approved by the
OpenFlow controller(s), since there is no central authority.</p>
<p>This is the only switch PKI model currently supported by NOX
(<a class="reference external" href="http://noxrepo.org">http://noxrepo.org</a>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Switch certificate authority: A certificate authority (the &quot;switch CA&quot;) signs
each Open vSwitch's public key.  The OpenFlow controllers then check that any
connecting switches' certificates are signed by that certificate authority.</p>
<p>This is the only switch PKI model supported by the simple OpenFlow controller
included with Open vSwitch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each Open vSwitch must also have a copy of the CA certificate for the
certificate authority that signs OpenFlow controllers' keys (the &quot;controller
CA&quot; certificate).  Typically, the same controller CA certificate is installed
on all of the switches within a given administrative unit.  There are two
common ways for a switch to obtain the controller CA certificate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Manually copy the certificate to the switch through some secure means, e.g.
using a USB flash drive, or over the network with &quot;scp&quot;, or even FTP or HTTP
followed by manual verification.</li>
<li>Open vSwitch &quot;bootstrap&quot; mode, in which Open vSwitch accepts and saves the
controller CA certificate that it obtains from the OpenFlow controller on its
first connection.  Thereafter the switch will only connect to controllers
signed by the same CA certificate.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="establishing-a-public-key-infrastructure">
<h1>Establishing a Public Key Infrastructure</h1>
<p>Open vSwitch can make use of your existing public key infrastructure.  If you
already have a PKI, you may skip forward to the next section.  Otherwise, if
you do not have a PKI, the ovs-pki script included with Open vSwitch can help.
To create an initial PKI structure, invoke it as:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-pki init
</pre>
<p>This will create and populate a new PKI directory.  The default location for
the PKI directory depends on how the Open vSwitch tree was configured (to see
the configured default, look for the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--dir</span></tt> option description in the output
of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-pki</span> <span class="pre">--help</span></tt>).</p>
<p>The pki directory contains two important subdirectories.  The <cite>controllerca</cite>
subdirectory contains controller CA files, including the following:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><cite>cacert.pem</cite></dt>
<dd>Root certificate for the controller certificate authority.  Each Open vSwitch
must have a copy of this file to allow it to authenticate valid controllers.</dd>
<dt><cite>private/cakey.pem</cite></dt>
<dd>Private signing key for the controller certificate authority.  This file must
be kept secret.  There is no need for switches or controllers to have a copy
of it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The <cite>switchca</cite> subdirectory contains switch CA files, analogous to those in the
<cite>controllerca</cite> subdirectory:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><cite>cacert.pem</cite></dt>
<dd>Root certificate for the switch certificate authority.  The OpenFlow
controller must have this file to enable it to authenticate valid switches.</dd>
<dt><cite>private/cakey.pem</cite></dt>
<dd>Private signing key for the switch certificate authority.  This file must be
kept secret.  There is no need for switches or controllers to have a copy of
it.</dd>
</dl>
<p>After you create the initial structure, you can create keys and certificates
for switches and controllers with ovs-pki.  Refer to the ovs-pki(8) manage for
complete details.  A few examples of its use follow:</p>
<div class="section" id="controller-key-generation">
<h2>Controller Key Generation</h2>
<p>To create a controller private key and certificate in files named
ctl-privkey.pem and ctl-cert.pem, run the following on the machine that
contains the PKI structure:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-pki req+sign ctl controller
</pre>
<p>ctl-privkey.pem and ctl-cert.pem would need to be copied to the controller for
its use at runtime.  If, for testing purposes, you were to use
ovs-testcontroller, the simple OpenFlow controller included with Open vSwitch,
then the --private-key and --certificate options, respectively, would point to
these files.</p>
<p>It is very important to make sure that no stray copies of ctl-privkey.pem are
created, because they could be used to impersonate the controller.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="switch-key-generation-with-self-signed-certificates">
<h2>Switch Key Generation with Self-Signed Certificates</h2>
<p>If you are using self-signed certificates (see &quot;SSL Concepts for OpenFlow&quot;),
this is one way to create an acceptable certificate for your controller to
approve.</p>

<div class="section" id="configuring-ssl-support">
<h1>Configuring SSL Support</h1>
<p>SSL configuration requires three additional configuration files.  The first two
of these are unique to each Open vSwitch.  If you used the instructions above
to build your PKI, then these files will be named <cite>sc-privkey.pem</cite> and
<cite>sc-cert.pem</cite>, respectively:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A private key file, which contains the private half of an RSA or DSA key.</p>
<p>This file can be generated on the Open vSwitch itself, for the greatest
security, or it can be generated elsewhere and copied to the Open vSwitch.</p>
<p>The contents of the private key file are secret and must not be exposed.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">A certificate file, which certifies that the private key is that of a
trustworthy Open vSwitch.</p>
<p>This file has to be generated on a machine that has the private key for the
switch certification authority, which should not be an Open vSwitch; ideally,
it should be a machine that is not networked at all.</p>
<p>The certificate file itself is not a secret.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The third configuration file is typically the same across all the switches in a
given administrative unit.  If you used the instructions above to build your
PKI, then this file will be named <cite>cacert.pem</cite>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The root certificate for the controller certificate authority.  The Open
vSwitch verifies it that is authorized to connect to an OpenFlow controller
by verifying a signature against this CA certificate.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have these files, configure ovs-vswitchd to use them using the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ovs-vsctl</span> <span class="pre">set-ssl</span></tt> command, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl set-ssl /etc/openvswitch/sc-privkey.pem \
    /etc/openvswitch/sc-cert.pem /etc/openvswitch/cacert.pem
</pre>
<p>Substitute the correct file names, of course, if they differ from the ones used
above.  You should use absolute file names (ones that begin with <tt class="docutils literal">/</tt>),
because ovs-vswitchd's current directory is unrelated to the one from which you
run ovs-vsctl.</p>
<p>If you are using self-signed certificates (see &quot;SSL Concepts for OpenFlow&quot;) and
you did not copy controllerca/cacert.pem from the PKI machine to the Open
vSwitch, then add the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">--bootstrap</span></tt> option, e.g.:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
$ ovs-vsctl -- --bootstrap set-ssl /etc/openvswitch/sc-privkey.pem \
    /etc/openvswitch/sc-cert.pem /etc/openvswitch/cacert.pem
</pre>
<p>After you have added all of these configuration keys, you may specify <tt class="docutils literal">ssl:</tt>
connection methods elsewhere in the configuration database.  <tt class="docutils literal">tcp:</tt> connection
methods are still allowed even after SSL has been configured, so for security
you should use only <tt class="docutils literal">ssl:</tt> connections.</p>
