SUMMARY:Transparent Validation (session A\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Hariprasad Govindharajan\, Intel.\n\nContributors 
 in the OVS community have their own validation needs\,\nconfigurations and
  requirements for each OVS release. As OVS and DPDK scale to\nadd more fea
 tures and functionality\, is there a need for a common community\ntest pla
 n with the aim of ensuring all OVS & DPDK functionality is being\nvalidate
 d\, not necessarily by just one contributor (which risks only a single\nco
 nfiguration being validated) but by the community as a whole? More\nimport
 antly is there an easy way to provide visibility on the validation\nproces
 s/progress for a given release to help aid the OVS community when\napproac
 hing release date?\n\nVisit https://ovscon.site/ for details and a link to
  the live stream when it becomes available.
