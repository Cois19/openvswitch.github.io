SUMMARY:Growing Pains - DPDKs move to API/ABI Stability and its effect on O
 VS (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ian Stokes\, Intel.\n\nWith DPDK 19.11\, the DPDK 
 community changed its approach towards\nABI/API compatibility with the aim
  of minimizing breakages for those consuming\nDPDK releases post 19.11. As
  such\, DPDK 20.11 is the first release since then\nto contain ABI/API cha
 nges. This talk will review the effort required for OVS\nto move between D
 PDK LTS releases pre DPDK 19.11 with the move to DPDK 20.11 as\nwell as di
 scussing issues raised in the community such as the need for\naccepting ex
 perimental APIs from the DPDK library in future for OVS releases.\n\nTo jo
