SUMMARY:Next steps for even higher performance of the SW Datapath in OVS (s
 ession B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Harry van Haaren\, Intel.\n\nContinuing in the pro
 gression of SW datapath optimizations\, this talk details\nhow the DPIF an
 d Miniflow Extract components of the Userspace datapath in OVS\ncan be fur
 ther optimized. The talk introduces the work achieved by DPIF and\nMiniflo
 w Extract\, and how the implementation today is based around memory\nacces
 ses.  By re-designing and re-thinking\, we convert todays memory-bound\nim
 plementation to a compute-bound problem\, enabling optimized SIMD solution
 s\nusing e.g. AVX512 for higher performance.\n\nTo join\, select from the
