SUMMARY:Debugging OVSDB with stream record/replay. (session B\, ovscon 2020
 )
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ilya Maximets\, Red Hat.\n\nOVSDB was originally d
 esigned to store configuration for Open vSwitch daemon.\nIt was intended t
 o handle fairly small amount of data that covers network\nconfiguration fo
 r a single host.  But\, at the same time\, it was designed to\nbe flexible
  and easy to talk with via OVSDB management protocol (RFC7047).\nToday OVN
  becomes a primary user of OVSDB and this rises new challenges in\nthe are
 a of performance and scale.  This talk is about debugging issues and\nperf
 ormance testing of OVSDB (and other components) in your OVN deployments.\n
 Just record the problematic use-case or a production workload and debug it
 \nwhile sitting at home and using only power of your own laptop.\n\nWe hop
 e that these patches will be accepted before the talk:\nhttps://patchwork.
