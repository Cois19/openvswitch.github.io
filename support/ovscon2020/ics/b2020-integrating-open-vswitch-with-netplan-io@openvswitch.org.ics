SUMMARY:Integrating Open vSwitch with Netplan.io (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Lukas Märdian\, Canonical.\n\nNetplan allows to de
 fine complex network scenarios in a descriptive manner via\nYAML files. Th
 ose can be rendered into corresponding configurations for the\nunderlying 
 backend technology\, such as systemd-networkd on Linux. The recent\nadditi
 on of Open vSwitch as a Netplan backend enables users to describe OVS\ncom
 ponents in combination with their existing Linux networking within the sam
 e\nYAML file. In this talk I will present how OVS was integrated as a Netp
 lan\nbackend and how it can be used in production.\n\nTo join\, select fro
