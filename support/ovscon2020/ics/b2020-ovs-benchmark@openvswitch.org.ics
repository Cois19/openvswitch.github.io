SUMMARY:OVS Benchmark (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Guy Twig and Roni Bar Yanai\, nVidia.\n\nVirtual s
 witches are a fundamental building block in the industry's movement\ntowar
 ds cloud-based (and SDN) environments.\n\nIn virtual switches\, switch str
 uctures have changed and switch functionality\nhas been greatly enhanced. 
 The new switch structure increases the switch\ncapabilities such so that\,
  for example\, switches can now also function as a\ndistributed switch. Fu
 rthermore\, new functionalities of the switch have\nprovided the switches 
 with tasks such as managing security groups on the\nswitching layer.\n\nWe
  recommend extending existing benchmarks\, such as RFC 2544\, RFC 8204  an
 d\nVSPERF suggested by OPNFV\, by using the new OVS benchmark which covers
  new use\ncases that address and emphasize the new structure and functiona
 lity of the\nvirtual switches.\n\nThe OVS benchmark takes into considerati
 on the common topologies currently in\nuse and addresses the extended swit
 ch functionality (such as underlay network\nand security groups). It also 
 addresses "realistic" profile scenarios.  A\ncommon profile now is one tha
 t defines a mix of sessions of different size\,\nduration\, and distributi
 on and generates traffic patterns that are closer to\nthe complex traffic 
 patterns seen on customers sites.\n\nAdopting this new standard will be be
 neficial for tracking OVS performance\,\nhardware offload performance\, an
 d comparison of other virtual switches.\n\nVisit https://ovscon.site/ for 
 details and a link to the live stream when it becomes available.
