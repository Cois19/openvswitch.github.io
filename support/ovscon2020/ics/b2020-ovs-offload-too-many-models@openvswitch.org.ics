SUMMARY:OvS Offload: Too Many Models? (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Hemal Shah\, Broadcom.\n\nOpen vSwitch (OvS) is a 
 widely deployed open source virtual switch today.  In\nthe last three year
 s\, several OvS data plane processing offload models\nincluding match offl
 oad\, partial actions offload\, full offload with SR-IOV\, and\nfull vhost
  offload have been proposed. These offload models take advantage of\nunder
 lying frameworks like Linux TC Flower and DPDK rte_flow.  Architecturally\
 ,\nit is not possible to fit a single OvS offload model into all use cases
  and\nworkloads. Furthermore\, the maturity of OvS offload models makes it
  hard to\ndeploy OvS offload solutions. In this talk\, we will provide an 
 overview of OvS\noffload models and pros/cons analysis for each one of the
 m. The goal is to help\nthe community understand the differences and chall
 enges with the overchoice of\nOvS offloads.\n\nVisit https://ovscon.site/ 
 for details and a link to the live stream when it becomes available.
