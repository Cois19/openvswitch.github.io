SUMMARY:p4proto: Cooking OVS with P4 Spice! (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Namrata Limaye and Deb Chatterjee\, Intel.\n\nThis
  presentation is about integrating two very powerful but dissimilar\nnetwo
 rking technologies. We want to simultaneously harness the power of the\nub
 iquitous presence of the OVS-like software switches\, and the flexibility 
 of\nprotocol and platform-independence that the P4 language provides. We m
 ust\nintegrate the two in a meaningful way to combine their strengths and 
 overcome\ntheir limitations. Our approach for this integration involves in
 troducing\np4proto as a parallel to ofproto within OVS\, that maps Openflo
 w tables to P4\ntables\, and establishes a compiler-based framework to eff
 iciently map the P4\ntables to any device's physical tables. We will also 
 talk about converting OVS\nconfigurations into P4 table configurations for
  LAG\, Mirroring\, CT and S-Flow\,\nto easily program these features on P4
  based data planes directly\, as compared\nto the current flow driven impl
 ementations of OVS.\n\nVisit https://ovscon.site/ for details and a link t
 o the live stream when it becomes available.
