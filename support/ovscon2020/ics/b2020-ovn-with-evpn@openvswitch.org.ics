SUMMARY:OVN with EVPN (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Ankur Kumar Sharma and Greg A Smith\, Nutanix.\n\n
 Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is evolving as the key technology to achieve\nnetwork 
 virtualization in data centers. It is used by hardware VTEPs\nto exchange 
 information that facilitates packet forwarding. EVPN uses\nMP BGP to distr
 ibute information about endpoints behind VTEPs.\n\nIn this talk\, we will 
 explain what all use cases we can achieve by\nintegrating OVN with EVPN.  
 We will primarily focus on different\nscenarios around achieving connectiv
 ity between OVN endpoints and\nendpoints behind hardware VTEPs. Additional
 ly\, we will also talk about\nhow we use the BGP distribution from FRR to 
 achieve the integration.\n\nTo join\, select from the following options:\n
