SUMMARY:OVS DPDK VXLAN & VLAN TSO\, GRO and GSO Implementation and Status U
 pdate (session A\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Yi Yang\, Inspur.\n\nAll the mainstream NICs can s
 upport VLAN TSO and VXLAN TSO\, VLAN TSO and VXLAN\nTSO can help improve b
 oth south-north and east-west TCP performance\ndramatically\, but unfortun
 ately OVS DPDK can’t support VXLAN TSO so far\, I have\nimplemented this a
 nd sent out v3 patch series. It isn’t enough to only have TSO\nsupport bec
 ause TSO can’t handle UDP fragment offload (UFO)\, so we have to\nbring in
  GSO implementation\, of course\, GRO support is also must-have\, TCP\nseg
 ments reassembling can improve TCP performance significantly in TSO case.\
 nDPDK only has VLAN/VXLAN TCP GRO and GSO\, it doesn’t implement VLAN/UDP 
 GRO and\nVXLAN UDP GRO as well as VXLAN UDP GSO\, I have implemented them 
 and fixed\nparent mbuf free issue in GSO case\, they should be merged by t
 his conference. I\nhave deployed it into our internal Openstack test envir
 onment\, TCP and UDP\nperformance are much better than current OVS DPDK. I
 n this talk\, I will present\nimplementation details\, current progress an
 d some issues we’re facing\, I hope\nOVS community can take it seriously a
 nd review and merge it as soon as\npossible\, this is really good thing to
  users.\n\nVisit https://ovscon.site/ for details and a link to the live s
 tream when it becomes available.
