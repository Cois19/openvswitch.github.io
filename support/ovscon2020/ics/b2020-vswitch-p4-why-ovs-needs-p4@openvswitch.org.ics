SUMMARY:vswitch.p4: Why OVS Needs P4 (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Dan Daly\, Intel.\n\nIn this talk we describe the 
 advantages of replacing the OpenFlow in OVS with\nP4.  We add a P4Runtime 
 interface to OVS to enable writing the forwarding\nprogram in P4.  This en
 codes more information on pipeline requirements\,\nallowing for a compiler
  to highly optimize the datapath based on these\nconstraints.  We use the 
 pipeline definitions of OVN and Antrea as examples of\nhow the OpenFlow ta
 ble configuration can be reproduced into a P4 program.  We\nshow that with
  this change in abstraction we can better optimize these\nforwarding progr
 ams and integrate them with connection tracking\, LAG\, tunnels\,\nrouting
 \, NAT and IPSec in a vswitch.p4 that describes a complete datapath\ninsta
 ntiated in Open vSwitch.\n\nTo join\, select from the following options:\n
