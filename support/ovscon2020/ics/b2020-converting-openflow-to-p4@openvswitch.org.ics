SUMMARY:Converting OpenFlow to P4 (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by James Choi\, Intel.\n\nWith ever-increasing need t
 o add the flexibility to their network packet\npipeline\, the adaptation o
 f P4 technology has been gaining popularity among the\nenterprise and clou
 d providers. P4 technology first gained popularity in\ndefining HW pipelin
 es\, and various work has been done to enable SW dataplanes\nthrough P4 as
  well. One of the challenges in adopting P4 in the control plane\nhas been
  incorporating P4 into widely deployed OpenFlow based orchestration.\nThis
  difficulty stems from the differences between OpenFlow and P4\nspecificat
 ions\, such as the differences in the flexibility of the tables entry\ntyp
 es and the restrictions in the action executions.\n\nIn this talk\, I will
  discuss the differences and the limits involved in mapping\nOpenFlow to P
 4\, along with some techniques in mapping OpenFlow constructs that\ndon't 
 naturally map to P4.  I will also discuss a mechanism that allows an SDN\n
 controller such as OVN to continue to use OpenFlow while providing annotat
 ions\nto map this into P4 tables in OVS.\n\nTo join\, select from the foll
