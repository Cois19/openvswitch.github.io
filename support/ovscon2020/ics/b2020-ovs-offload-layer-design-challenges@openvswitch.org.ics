SUMMARY:OvS Offload Layer Design Challenges (session B\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Hemal Shah and Sriharsha Basavapatna\, Broadcom.\n
 \nOpen vSwitch (OvS) offload layer is a control plane that resides between
 \nthe OvS and the network device layer. The offload layer interfaces with 
 the\nunderlying infrastructure like Linux TC flower or DPDK rte_flow. The\
 ncurrent design of the offload layer is not optimized for dynamic\nrebalan
 cing of offloaded flows\, control plane performance\, and multi-flow\noffl
 oads. In this talk\, we will review the challenges with the offload\nlayer
  including single thread model\, offload sequencing\, and offload state\nm
 aintenance. We will propose design improvements to the offload layer.\n\nV

 t becomes available.
