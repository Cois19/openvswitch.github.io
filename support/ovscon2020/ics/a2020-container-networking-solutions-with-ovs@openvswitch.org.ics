SUMMARY:Container Networking solutions with OVS (session A\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Anjali S Jain and Nupur Jain\, Intel.\n\nOVS is be
 coming the vSwitch of choice even for Container networking.  OpenShift\n& 
 Antrea are an example of that adoption.  The challenges that come with tha
 t\nare two folds. One of exposing a container interface(Application Socket
 ) as a\nswitching port to OVS. Typically Application sockets don't get exp
 osed as a\nforwarding end point in a vSwitch. The switching endpoint at pr
 esent is a\nPod. The Iptables used to load balance or direct the traffic t
 o a Container\nsocket is not integrated well in the vSwitch. The second ch
 allenge is of\nAccelerating/offloading this Container interface into HW of
 floaded\nvSwitch. This talk presents solution in this space using sub-func
 tions/Sub-dev\ndeployed on Ancillary bus (Kernel patches under review).  T
 here are also a few\ntechnological innovations happening in parallel in th
 e virtualization space\nthat help with the solution\, for example scalable
  IOV and AF_XDP sockets. We\nwill present the SW building blocks for achie
 ving this makeover for OVS. We\nwill also talk about the scale challenge a
 nd whether Netdev based Port\nrepresentors are up to that challenge.\n\nTo
