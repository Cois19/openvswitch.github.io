SUMMARY:Port Mirroring Offload (session A\, ovscon 2020)
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Timothy Miskell\, Larry Wang\, and Emma Finn\, Int
 el and Munish Mehan\, AT&T.\n\nTraffic monitoring in a Software Defined Ne
 twork (SDN) based networking\ninfrastructure is critical\, particularly as
  an increasing number of traditional\nnetwork functions are deployed over 
 virtualized infrastructures.  Similar to\ntraditional deployments\, traffi
 c monitoring ensures the security\, performance\,\nand transparency of the
  underlying network. In the context of virtualized\ninfrastructures\, depl
 oyment of a virtualized Test Access Point (TAP) service\nhas been reported
  as an effective Virtual Network Function (VNF) that can\nprovide similar 
 monitoring capabilities to a physical TAP.  Unfortunately\, in\nan environ
 ment such as Open vSwitch\, where inter-VM communication can be\nexpensive
 \, it has been observed that virtual TAPs can contribute up to 70%\nperfor
 mance degradation to a given source VNF. As part of this talk and live\nde
 monstration\, we present a hybrid approach that allows network administrat
 ors\nto mirror VIRTIO port traffic to another Virtual Function (SR-IOV) vi
 a NIC\nhardware offloading.  Our results show that the mirrored traffic ca
 n be viewed\nthrough a monitoring VNF\, residing within a separate VM\, wh
 ile simultaneously\nreducing the throughput overhead on the source VNF by 
 as much as 50%.\n\nTo join\, select from the following options:\n\n1) Web
