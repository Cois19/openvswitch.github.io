<p>The goal of this configuration cookbook is to monitor traffic sent between two VMs on the same physical host using an sFlow collector.</p>

<h2>Environment</h2>

<p>This configuration cookbook assumes an environment configured as described in the sections below.

<h3>Two Physical Networks</h3>

<ul>
<li>Data Network: This Ethernet network is for VM data traffic. For experimentation, this physical network is optional. You can instead connect all VMs to a bridge that is not connected to a physical interface.</li>
<li>Management Network: This network must exist, as it is used to send sFlow data from the agent to the remote collector.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Two Physical Hosts</h3>

<p>The cookbook assumes the use of two physical hosts, referred to here as Host1 and Monitoring Host.

<p>Host1 is a hypervisor that runs Open vSwitch and has two NICs:</p>

<ul>
<li>eth0 is connected to the Data Network. No IP address can be assigned on eth0 because it is part of an OVS bridge.</li>
<li>eth1 is connected to the Management Network. eth1 has an IP address for management traffic, including sFlow.</li>
</ul>

<p>Monitoring Host can be any computer that can run the sFlow collector. For this cookbook entry, we use <a href="http://www.inmon.com/products/sFlowTrend.php">sFlowTrend</a>, a free sFlow collector that is a simple cross-platform Java download. Other sFlow collectors should work equally well. Monitoring Host has a single NIC, eth0, that is connected to the Management Network. eth0 has an IP adress that can reach eth1 on Host1.</p>

<h3>Two Virtual Machines</h3>

<p>This cookbook entry uses two virtual machines (VM1 and VM2) running on Host1.</p>

<p>Each VM has a single interface that appears as a Linux device (e.g., "tap0") on the physical host. (Note: for Xen/XenServer, VM interfaces appears as Linux devices with names like "vif1.0". Other Linux systems may present these interfaces as "vnet0", "vnet1", etc.)</p>

<p>This diagram depicts the environment used by this configuration cookbook entry:</p>

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>On Host1, define the following configuration values in your shell environment.</p>

<p><code>COLLECTOR_IP=10.0.0.1<br />
COLLECTOR_PORT=6343<br />
AGENT_IP=eth1<br />
HEADER_BYTES=128<br />
SAMPLING_N=64<br />
POLLING_SECS=10</code></p>

<p>Port 6343 (<code>COLLECTOR_PORT</code>) is the default port number for sFlowTrend. If you are using an sFlow collector other than sFlowTrend, set this value to the appropriate port for your particular collector. Set your own IP address for the collector in the place of 10.0.0.1 (<code>COLLECTOR_IP</code>). Setting the <code>AGENT_IP</code> value to eth1 indicates that the sFlow agent should send traffic from eth1's IP address. The other values indicate settings regarding the frequency and type of packet sampling that sFlow should perform.</p></li>

<li><p>Still on Host1, run the following command to create an sFlow configuration and attach it to bridge br0:</p>

<p><code>ovs-vsctl -- --id=@sflow create sflow agent=${AGENT_IP} \ <br /> target=\"${COLLECTOR_IP}:${COLLECTOR_PORT}\" header=${HEADER_BYTES} \ <br /> sampling=${SAMPLING_N} polling=${POLLING_SECS} -- set bridge br0 sflow=@sflow</code></p>

<p>Make note of the UUID that is returned by this command; this value is necessary to remove the sFlow configuration.</p></li>

<li><p>On Monitoring Host, go to the<a href="http://www.inmon.com/products/sFlowTrend.php"> sFlowTrend homepage</a> and click "Install" in the upper right-hand corner. If you have Java installed, this will download and start the sFlowTrend application. Once sFlowTrend is running, the light in the lower right-hand corner of the sFlowTrend application should blink green to indicate that the collector is receiving traffic.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The sFlow configuration is now complete, and sFlowTrend on Monitoring Host should be receiving sFlow data from OVS on Host1.</p>

<p>To configure sFlow on additional bridges, just replace "br0" in the above command with a different bridge name.</p>

<p>To remove sFlow configuration from a bridge (in this case, "br0"), run this command, where "sFlow UUID" is the UUID returned by the command used to set the sFlow configuration initially:</p>

<p><code>ovs-vsctl remove bridge br0 sflow &lt;sFlow UUID&gt;</code></p>

<p>To see all current sets of sFlow configuration parameters, run:</p>

<p><code>ovs-vsctl list sflow</code></p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>If sFlow data isn't being collected and displayed by sFlowTrend, check the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the VMs are sending/receiving network traffic over bridge br0, preferably to multiple other hosts and using a variety of protocols.</li>
<li><p>To confirm that the agent is sending traffic, check that running the following command shows that the agent on the physical server is sending traffic to the collector IP address (change the port below to match the port your collector is using):</p>

<p><code>tcpdump -ni eth1 udp port 6343</code></p></li>

<p>If no traffic is being sent, there is a problem with the configuration of OVS. If traffic is being sent but nothing is visible in the sFlowTrend user interface, this may indicate a configuration problem with the collector.</p></li>
<li>Check to make sure the host running the collector (Monitoring Host) does not have a firewall that would prevent UDP port 6343 from reaching the collector.</li>
</ul>
