OVS Committer Grant/Revocation Policy<br />
=====================================<br />
<p>An OVS committer is a participant in the project with the ability<br />
to commit code directly to the master repository.  Commit access<br />
grants a broad ability to affect the progress of the project as<br />
presented by its most important artifact, the code and related<br />
resources that produce working binaries of Open vSwitch.  As such<br />
it represents a significant level of trust in an individual's<br />
commitment to working with other committers and the community at<br />
large for the benefit of the project.  It can not be granted<br />
lightly and, in the worst case, must be revocable if the trust<br />
placed in an individual was inappropriate.</p>
<p>This document suggests guidelines for granting and revoking commit<br />
access.  It is intended provide a framework for evaluation of such<br />
decisions without specifying deterministic rules that wouldn't be<br />
sensitive to the nuance of specific situations.  In the end the<br />
decision to grant or revoke committer privileges is a judgment call<br />
made by the existing set of committers.</p>
<p>Granting Commit Access<br />
----------------------<br />
Granting commit access should be considered when a candidate has<br />
demonstrated the following in their interaction with the project:</p>
<p>- Contribution of significant new features through the patch<br />
  submission process where:<br />
  - Submissions are free of obvious critical defects<br />
  - Submissions do not typically require many iterations of<br />
    improvement to be accepted<br />
- Consistent participation in code review of other's patches,<br />
  including existing committers, with comments consistent with the<br />
  overall project standards<br />
- Assistance to those in the community who are less knowledgeable<br />
  through active participation in project forums such as the<br />
  ovs-discuss mailing list.<br />
- Plans for sustained contribution to the project compatible with<br />
  the project's direction as viewed by current committers.<br />
- Commitment to meet the expectations described in the<br />
  "Expectations of Developer's with Open vSwitch Access"</p>
<p>The process to grant commit access to a candidate is simple:</p>
<p>- An existing committer nominates the candidate by sending an<br />
  emailing to all existing committers with information<br />
  substantiating the contributions of the candidate in the areas<br />
  described above.<br />
- All existing committers discuss the pros and cons of granting<br />
  commit access to the candidate in the email thread.<br />
- When the discussion has converged or a reasonable time has<br />
  elapsed without discussion developing (e.g a few business days)<br />
  the nominator calls for a final decision on the candidate with a<br />
  followup email to the thread.<br />
- Each committer may vote yes, no, or to abstain by replying to the<br />
  email thread.  A failure to reply is an implicit abstention.<br />
- After votes from all existing committers have been collected or a<br />
  reasonable time has elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a<br />
  couple of business days) the votes are evaluated.  To be granted<br />
  commit access the candidate must receive yes votes from a<br />
  majority of the existing committers and zero no votes.  Since a<br />
  no vote is effectively a veto of the candidate it should be<br />
  accompanied by a reason for the vote.<br />
- The nominator summarizes the result of the vote in an email to<br />
  the all existing committers.<br />
- If the vote to grant commit access passed, the candidate is<br />
  contacted with an invitation to become a committer to the project<br />
  which asks them to agree to the committer expectations<br />
  documented on the project web site.<br />
- If the candidate agrees access is granted by setting up commit<br />
  access to the repos on github.</p>
<p>Revoking Commit Access<br />
----------------------<br />
There are two situations in which commit access might be revoked.</p>
<p>The straightforward situation is a committer who is no longer<br />
active in the project and has no plans to become active in the near<br />
future.  The process in this case is:</p>
<p>- Any time after a committer has been inactive for more than 6<br />
  months any other committer to the project may identify that<br />
  committer as a candidate for revocation of commit access due to<br />
  inactivity.<br />
- The plans of the candidate for revocation should be consulted in<br />
  a private email to the candidate.<br />
  - If the candidate for removal states plans to continue<br />
    participating no action is taken and this process terminates.<br />
  - If the candidate replies they no longer require commit<br />
    access then commit access is removed and a notification is<br />
    sent to the candidate and all existing committers.<br />
  - If the candidate can not be reached within 1 week of the first<br />
    attempting to contact this process continues.<br />
- A message proposing removal of commit access is sent to the<br />
  candidate and all other committers.<br />
  - If the candidate for removal states plans to continue<br />
    participating no action is taken.<br />
  - If the candidate replies they no longer require commit<br />
    access then their access is removed.<br />
  - If the candidate can not be reached within 2 months of the<br />
    second attempting to contact them, access is removed.<br />
- In any case, where access is removed, this fact is published<br />
  through an email to all existing committers (including the<br />
  candidate for removal).</p>
<p>The more difficult situation is a committer who is behaving in a<br />
manner that is viewed as detrimental to the future of the project<br />
by other committers.  This is a delicate situation with the<br />
potential for the creation of division within the greater<br />
community and should be handled with care.  The process in this<br />
case is:</p>
<p>- Discuss the behavior of concern with the individual privately and<br />
  explain why you believe it is detrimental to the project.  Stick<br />
  to the facts and keep the email professional.  Avoid personal<br />
  attacks and the temptation to hypothesize about unknowable<br />
  information such as the other's motivations.  Make it clear that<br />
  you would prefer not to discuss the behavior more widely but will<br />
  have to raise it with other contributors if it does not change.<br />
  Ideally the behavior is eliminated and no further action is<br />
  required.  If not,<br />
- Start an email thread with all committers, including the source<br />
  of the behavior, describing the behavior and the reason it is<br />
  detrimental to the project.  The message should have the same<br />
  tone as the private discussion and should generally repeat the<br />
  same points covered in that discussion.  The person whose<br />
  behavior is being questioned should not be surprised by anything<br />
  presented in this discussion.  Ideally the wider discussion<br />
  provides more perspective to all participants and the issue is<br />
  resolved.  If not,<br />
- Start an email thread with all committers except the source of<br />
  the detrimental behavior requesting a vote on revocation of<br />
  commit rights.  Cite the discussion among all committers and<br />
  describe all the reasons why it was not resolved satisfactorily.<br />
  This email should be careful written with the knowledge that the<br />
  reasoning it contains may be published to the larger community<br />
  to justify the decision.<br />
- Each committer may vote yes, no, or to abstain by replying to the<br />
  email thread.  A failure to reply is an implicit abstention.<br />
- After all votes have been collected or a reasonable time has<br />
  elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days)<br />
  the votes are evaluated.  For the request to revoke commit access<br />
  for the candidate to pass it must receive yes votes from two<br />
  thirds of the existing committers.<br />
  - anyone that votes no must provide their reasoning, and<br />
  - if the proposal passes then counter-arguments for the reasoning in<br />
    no votes should also be documented along with the initial reasons<br />
    the revocation was proposed.  Ideally there should be no new<br />
    counter-arguments supplied in a no vote all concerns should<br />
    have surfaced in the discussion before the vote.<br />
- The original person to propose revocation summarizes the result<br />
  of the vote in an email to all existing committers excepting the<br />
  candidate for removal.<br />
- If the vote to revoke commit access passes access is removed and<br />
  the candidate for revocation is informed of that fact and the<br />
  reasons for it as documented in the email requesting the<br />
  revocation vote.<br />
  - Ideally the revoked committer peacefully leaves the community<br />
    and no further action is required.  However, there is a<br />
    distinct possibility that he/she will try to generate support<br />
    for his/her point of view within the larger community.  In<br />
    this case the reasoning for removing commit access as<br />
    described in the request for a vote will be published to the<br />
    community.</p>
<p>Changing the Policy<br />
-------------------<br />
The process for changing the policy is:</p>
<p>- Propose the changes to the policy in an email to all current<br />
  committers and request discussion.<br />
- After an appropriate period of discussion (a few days) update<br />
  the proposal based on feedback if required and resend it to all<br />
  current committers with a request for a formal vote.<br />
- After all votes have been collected or a reasonable time has<br />
  elapsed for them to be provided (e.g. a couple of business days)<br />
  the votes are evaluated.  For the request to modify the policy to<br />
  pass it must receive yes votes from two thirds of the existing<br />
  committers.</p>

<p>Proposal to Remove Commit Access for Inactivity<br />
-----------------------------------------------<br />
Committer &lt;candidate&gt; has been inactive for &lt;duration&gt;.  I have<br />
attempted to privately contacted &lt;him/her&gt; and &lt;he/she&gt; could not<br />
be reached.</p>
<p>Based on this I would like to formally propose removal of commit<br />
access.  If a response to this message documenting the reasons to<br />
retain commit access is not received by &lt;date&gt; access will be<br />
removed.</p>
<p>Notification of Commit Removal for Inactivity<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Committer &lt;candidate&gt; has been inactive for &lt;duration&gt;.  &lt;He/she&gt;<br />
&lt;stated no commit access is required/failed to respond to the<br />
formal proposal to remove access on &lt;date&gt;.  Commit access has<br />
now been removed.</p>
<p>Proposal to Revoke Commit Access for Detrimental Behavior<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
I regret that I feel compelled to propose revocation of commit<br />
access for &lt;candidate&gt;.  I have privately discussed with &lt;him/her&gt;<br />
the following reasons I believe &lt;his/her&gt; actions are detrimental<br />
to the project and we have failed to come to a mutual<br />
understanding:</p>
