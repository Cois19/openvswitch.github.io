Expectations for Developers with Open vSwitch Repo Access<br />
=========================================================
<p>Prerequisites<br />
-------------</p>
<p>Be familiar with CodingStyle and CONTRIBUTING.</p>
<p>Review<br />
------</p>
<p>Code (yours or others') must be reviewed publicly (by you or others)<br />
before you push it to the repository.  With one exception (see below),<br />
every change needs at least one review.</p>
<p>If one or more people know an area of code particularly well, code<br />
that affects that area should ordinarily get a review from one of<br />
them.</p>
<p>The riskier, more subtle, or more complicated the change, the more<br />
careful the review required.  When a change needs careful review, use<br />
good judgment regarding the quality of reviews.  If a change adds 1000<br />
lines of new code, and a review posted 5 minutes later says just<br />
"Looks good," then this is probably not a quality review.</p>
<p>(The size of a change is correlated with the amount of care needed in<br />
review, but it is not strictly tied to it.  A search and replace<br />
across many files may not need much review, but one-line optimization<br />
changes can have widespread implications.)</p>
<p>Your own small changes to fix a recently broken build ("make") or<br />
tests ("make check"), that you believe to be visible to a large number<br />
of developers, may be checked in without review.  If you are not sure,<br />
ask for review.  If you do push a build fix without review, send the<br />
patch to ovs-dev afterward as usual, indicating in the email that you<br />
have already pushed it.</p>
<p>Regularly review submitted code in areas where you have expertise.<br />
Consider reviewing other code as well.</p>
<p>Git conventions<br />
---------------</p>
<p>Do not push merge commits to the Git repository without prior<br />
discussion on ovs-dev.</p>
<p>If you apply a change (yours or another's) then it is your<br />
responsibility to handle any resulting problems, especially broken<br />
builds and other regressions.  If it is someone else's change, then<br />
you can ask the original submitter to address it.  Regardless, you<br />
need to ensure that the problem is fixed in a timely way.  The<br />
definition of "timely" depends on the severity of the problem.</p>
<p>If a bug is present on master and other branches, fix it on master<br />
first, then backport the fix to other branches.  Straightforward<br />
backports do not require additional review (beyond that for the fix on<br />
master).</p>
<p>Feature development should be done only on master.  Occasionally it<br />
makes sense to add a feature to the most recent release branch, before<br />
the first actual release of that branch.  These should be handled in<br />
the same way as bug fixes, that is, first implemented on master and<br />
then backported.</p>
<p>Keep the authorship of a commit clear by maintaining a correct list of<br />
"Signed-off-by:"s.  If a confusing situation comes up, as it<br />
occasionally does, bring it up on the mailing list.  If you explain<br />
the use of Signed-off-by: to a new developer, explain not just how but<br />
why, since the intended meaning of Signed-off-by: is more important<br />
than the syntax.  As part of your explanation, quote or provide a URL<br />
to the Developer's Certificate of Origin in SubmittingPatches.</p>
<p>Use Reported-by: and Tested-by: tags in commit messages to indicate<br />
the source of a bug report.</p>
<p>Keep the AUTHORS file up to date.</p>
