<strong>Silicon Loons</strong> <a href="http://www.siliconloons.com/?p=277">Virtual Machines on Fedora 17 with Open vSwitch</a> My previous blog post showed you how to setup Open vSwitch (including LACP port-channels) on your Fedora 17 host. Once you have this working, creating virtual machines and adding them to one of your Open vSwitch bridges is the next logical step. For this setup, we will make use of libvirt to manage our virtual machines. We&rsquo;ll utilize virt-manager (a GUI) and virsh (a CLI) to manage the VMs on the host. But the VMs themselves, once running on Fedora with libvirt and KVM, can easily be migrated into an oVirt setup, for instance.</p>

OpenStack is an open stack cloud effort that Red Hat has some involvement with and the embrace of Open vSwitch in Fedora is a huge step in my opinion. It means that the Fedora community will get to test out and use this virtual switch making the path to OpenStack Quantum for Fedora users, relatively easy. OpenStack Essex (the upcoming release) is also set for inclusion in Fedora 17 as is the full Quantum stack."</p>
