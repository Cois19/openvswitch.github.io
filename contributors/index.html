<p>The most up-to-date list of contributors is available in <a href="{{site.gitrawfileviewerurl}}AUTHORS">AUTHORS</a>, part of the Open vSwitch distribution.</p>

<p>
  Open vSwitch also has a smaller group of committers, people who have
  been granted access to push changes directly to the OVS Git
  repository.  The responsibilities of an OVS committer are documented
  in <a href="{{site.gitfileviewerurl}}Documentation/committer-responsibilities.md">Documentation/committer-responsibilities.md</a>.
  The process for adding or removing committers is
  in <a href="{{site.gitfileviewerurl}}Documentation/committer-grant-revocation.md">Documentation/committer-grant-revocation.md</a>.
  The current list of Open vSwitch committers is
  in <a href="{{site.gitfileviewerurl}}MAINTAINERS.md">MAINTAINERS.md</a>.
