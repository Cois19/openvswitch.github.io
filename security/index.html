<p>This page summarizes the Open vSwitch vulnerability reporting process.  For full information, please see <a href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/SECURITY.md">SECURITY.md</a> in the Open vSwitch source tree.</p>
<h2>Security patches</h2>
<p>When security patches are released, they will be announced on the <i>ovs-announce</i> and <i>ovs-discuss</i> mailing lists. A security advisory will also be posted to the Open vSwitch webpage.
Patches will be pushed to the <i>ovs-dev</i> mailing list (noting that they are already applied).</p>
<p>When the patch is applied to LTS (long-term support) branches, a new version will be released.</p>

<h2>How to report a security vulnerability</h2>
<p>To report an Open vSwitch vulnerability, send an email to the <i>ovs-security</i> mailing list (<a href="mailto:security@openvswitch.org">security@openvswitch.org</a>). A security team member will reply to the reporter acknowledging that the report has been received.</p>
<p>Please <b>don't</b> report security vulnerabilities to the <i>ovs-dev</i> list, <i>ovs-bugs</i> list or github issues to allow the OVS security team to responsibly fix the vulnerability.</p>
<p>Please consider reporting the information mentioned in <a href="https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/master/REPORTING-BUGS.md">REPORTING-BUGS.md</a>, where relevant.</p>
<p>Reporters may ask for a GPG key while initiating contact with the security team to deliver more sensitive reports.</p>
