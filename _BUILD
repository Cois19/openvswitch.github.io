- Install jekyll

Develop the website
-------------------

- Run
    jekyll serve -w
  in the site main directory
- Go to http://localhost:4000/

Even though jekyll is a static site generator, when run with -w it will
monitor the source directory for changes and rebuild the website
automatically.

Deploy the website
------------------

- Run
    jekyll build
  in the site main directory
- The output will be in the _site/ subdirectory. It can be exported
  with any static HTTP server

Deploy the website (github pages)
---------------------------------

Github pages support Jekyll. The site source code can be uploaded to a repo
and it will be automatically compiled and exported.
