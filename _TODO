OPEN ISSUES

1) Releases
    This repository currently does not host ovs releases as the oldwebsite did.
    Proposals:
        a) do not host them. Let github generate the files through tags
            + simple
            - Is github reliable? does the file change? Some user might
              expect it to have a consistent hash
        b) upload them to the website git repository

2) /cgi-bin/man
    There was a script on the old website that generated updated (from master)
    man pages (in PDF and HTML). There are some links to these pages somewhere
    on the website. Proposals:
        a) upload static version of the manpages
            - they do not get updated

3) /pipermail/
    http://openvswitch.org/pipermail is the mailman archive. If we use github
    hosting, openvswitch.org will be a CNAME for openvswitch.github.io
    (or something similar). Since we do not have control over
    openvswitch.github.io we cannot redirect /pipermail/* to something else.

4) google analytics
    include google analytics snippet
